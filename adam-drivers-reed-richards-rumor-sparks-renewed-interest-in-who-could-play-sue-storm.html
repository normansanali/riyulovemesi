Perceptive fanatics seemed to learn through the grapevine, thanks to some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">convincing fan edits</a>, that Penn Badgley — the star of Netflix’s psychological thriller series You — would be taking on the mantle of Reed Richards from the most recent rendition, which would be John Krasinski’s cameo in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Although it seemed foolproof, nothing ever came of the supposed news, which is — as we mentioned — almost a month old with no new developments. But now, our interest is piqued by the sea of possibilities regarding who might be the next <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sue Storm</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>As it always does, the rumor mill churned and churned as casting announcements got so close, we could almost taste them. Alas, there has yet to be any word from Marvel that’s concrete and not just hopefuls on the internet pushing their predictions. Most recently in Marvel land, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Driver has been eyed as the MCU’s Reed Richards</a>, which would well and truly leave Krasinski’s short-lived portrayal in the dust — especially considering he met his demise at the hands of the Scarlet Witch in the Doctor Strange sequel.</p><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Star Wars die-hards obviously know Driver as none other than Kylo Ren, but his talent knows no bounds. He recently starred in the sci-fi action-thriller 65, but perhaps his most recognizable roles come from House of Gucci, BlacKkKlansman, and The Last Duel, the latter of which co-stars Matt Damon and Jodie Comer. But obviously, we can’t have Reed Richards without Sue Storm; that’s like peanut butter with jelly, salt without pepper, the sun without the moon — utterly unthinkable. And — speaking of Jodie Comer — take a wild guess who the Marvel fans are campaigning to cast as Driver’s right-hand woman?</p><p data-characters=642 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>You guessed it. The 30-year-old Liverpudlian, who landed her breakout role in the British drama series My Mad Fat Diary, went on to star in one of BBC’s most successful crime-thrillers shows, Killing Eve, before making the move to Hollywood and starring alongside Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds, in Free Guy. Nowadays, Comer has revisited her roots to star on Broadway in Prima Facie. She’s been rumored to be joining the MCU since turning heads alongside the Canadian-American treasure that is Sandra Oh in Killing Eve, so it shouldn’t be surprising to hear her name tossed around for the role of a lifetime in Sue Storm.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>But it isn’t just Comer who’s got a shot at joining the big leagues. Mila Kunis, Vanessa Kirby, Amanda Seyfried, and Allison Williams are among the long list of names in the running to play the Invisible Woman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>RUMOR: Jodie Comer, Mila Kunis, Vanessa Kirby, and Allison Williams are names that are in the running to portray Sue Storm in Matt Shakman’s FANTASTIC FOUR for the MCU</p><p>(Source: <a href=#>@GraceRandolph</a>) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LVKtxFRXYv</a></p>— Marvel Focus (@TheMarvelFocus) <a href=#>April 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Just a gentle reminder that this is all speculation for the time being, so we can’t know for certain who’ll be chosen, but the fans have flocked to the comments on Twitter, casting their vote out of the prime candidates.
