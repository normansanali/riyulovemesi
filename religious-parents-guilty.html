At the time of his death, witnesses said that Radita weighed less than 40 pounds.</p><p>“Mr. and Mrs. Radita intended to and did isolate Alex from anyone who could intervene or monitor his insulin treatment aside from themselves,” said Canada Justice Karen Horner, according to <a href=#>The Canadian Press</a>.</p><p>“Alex died as a result of bacterial sepsis brought on by extreme starvation. His physical condition at death was not a sudden or quick occurrence but rather took place over months and possibly, probably years.”</p><p>He was one of eight children his parents Emil Radita, 60, and Rodica Radita, 54, had together. The pair — whose attorney argued lacked the means, not the desire to care for their now-deceased child — will now serve a life sentence in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years, for actively withholding insulin from Alexandru despite knowing the consequences.</p><p>“The evidence underscores that the Raditas were well aware how ill Alex was and still refused to treat his medical condition with proper insulin protocol and medical care,” Horner said. “They knew he was dying.”</p><p>Sadly, there is even more evidence that without his parents, Alexandru Radita would have lived a long and prosperous life. British Columbia (B.C.) social workers had once taken Alexandru Radita away and placed him into foster care when he was hospitalized close to death as a five-year-old.</p><p>He thrived in foster care, witnesses say, for nearly a year until his parents regained custody and moved the family to a different Canadian province.</p><p>“I’m happy with the verdict. I think that it really is justice for Alex. He went through a horrible ending to his life and I’m glad to see his parents being held accountable,” said Patricia MacDonald, one of the B.C. social workers who had tried saving Alexandru Radita from his parents, according to The Canadian Press.</p><p>“I just feel like they’re so empty,” MacDonald added. “They’re void of any kind of emotion, any kind of feeling. I’ve never met parents like them in my life.”</p><p>That emotional emptiness seemed to apply on the day of Alexandru’s death as well. The family, whose religious beliefs included not visiting doctors, attended church to say that their son had died — but that God had resurrected him.</p><p>Next, check out the <a href=#>sick Minnesota boy</a> who died after his parents prayed for him instead of calling ambulance, before reading up on the <a href=#>five devastating diseases</a> whose origins medical experts once got entirely wrong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscuinqKnpah6sa3RnqWtq12cwqq407I%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./racism-allegations-rock-hollywood-danielle-rose-russell-and-kat-graham-in-spotlight.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Racism allegations rock Hollywood: Danielle Rose Russell and Kat Graham in spotlight - SarkariResult</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mikaila-dancer-confidence-t-shirt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mikaila Dancer Confidence T-Shirt | Fan Arch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
