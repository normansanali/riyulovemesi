Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=braunwyn-39-s-relationships>Braunwyn's Relationships</h2><p><a href=#>Braunwyn and Sean's marriage</a> has been hard for some people to understand, but on Braunwyn's final season of RHOC, Braunwyn came out and shared that they were going to stay married but she would be dating women.</p><p>Braunwyn shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Fernanda Rocha were in a relationship</a>, but they broke up after a few months together. According to Us Weekly, Braunwyn said last year, “The first time that we went from friends to maybe a little more — and, like, barely more — was in February. We did not start dating until a month after she filed for divorce [from Tessa Rocha]. We can both date other people. She just got out of a marriage. We’re both in our forties. You know, we really love the time we spend together. She’s amazing. She’s an amazing person, but neither one of us is rushing into labels. … We don’t need to label [the time] we spend together.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's interesting to note that Fernanda was on RHOC back in season 6, as a "friend."
