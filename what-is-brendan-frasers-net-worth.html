His first leading role was in the comedy Encino Man, also known as California Man outside the U.S, in 1992 alongside Pauly Shore and Sean Astin. Playing the caveman learning to live in the 20th century established his gift for cinematic comedy, leading to roles in comedies like Airheads, George of the Jungle, and Bedazzled.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>He is probably most famous for headlining Universal’s action-horror <a href=#>Mummy</a> trilogy between 1999 and 2008.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Inspired to act after visiting London’s West End on vacation, Fraser has also demonstrated his dramatic abilities throughout his career. He starred opposite Sir McKellen in the Academy Award-winning Gods and Monsters in 1998 and Sir Michael Caine in 2002’s The Quiet American. He was also part of the ensemble cast of Crash, which won three Academy Awards in 2006.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Brendan_Fraser_Mummy-533x360.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>While The Mummy trilogy was a huge success, its influence extending most recently to Marvel’s Moonknight on Disney+, Fraser’s career took a few detours. Around 2014, the actor stepped back from acting in big-budget movies to concentrate on notable roles and cameos on television. He subsequently piled up credits in shows like Scrubs, Trust, and The Affair.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>In 2018, Fraser took a regular role as part of DC Entertainment’s alternative superhero team Doom Patrol, voicing Cliff ‘Robotman’ Steele and playing him in flashbacks. That role hinted at the actor’s return to feature films.&nbsp;In 2022, he’s set to wear a heat-proof costume as Firefly in Batgirl, facing- and flaming-off against Leslie Grace’s Barbara Gordon. Opposing Fraser’s pyromaniac villain alongside Grace will be J. K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Keaton as Batman.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Batgirl is the next stage in Fraser’s return to high-profile movies. In 2021, Fraser joined the ensemble cast of Steven Soderbergh’s No Sudden Move. We’ll see him at movie theaters over the next year in Darren Aronofsky’s Whale, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, and Dalibor Stach’s Behind the Curtain of Night.</p><h3 id=h-what-is-brendan-fraser-s-net-worth data-injectable=false><strong>What Is Brendan Fraser’s Net Worth?&nbsp;</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false>As of 2022, Brendan Fraser’s net worth is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated to be $20 million</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>Despite taking a break from the larger-scale films he was associated with for much of his thirty-year career, most of Fraser’s earnings have come from acting, though he has also taken roles on the other side of the camera.
