The late Beatle won the hearts of his generation with songs about peace and love, his tenacious anti-war activism, and his tenure with the record-breaking band. All of this made him a hero to both his fellow baby boomers and to modern fans of classic rock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, not everyone loves the rock and roll legend anymore. A trend on the video streaming app <a href=#>TikTok</a> has begun where millennial and gen-Z creators are canceling John Lennon. 'For you' pages are now filled with youths voicing strong opinions about John Lennon and it has caused his fans to leap to his defense. Other fans, however, are starting to abandon their fandom as they learn about some of the problematic aspects of John Lennon’s history. While Lennon remains loved by boomers, zoomers do not seem as eager to embrace his legacy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Things You Didn't Know About John Lennon and Yoko Ono</a></span></p><p>Most of the recent controversy revolves around revelations about Lennon’s less than celebratory antics, like his unfortunate record of domestic abuse, something that Lennon confessed to while he was still alive, and many feel that he never endured consequences for his actions. Since options are limited when you want to hold a dead man accountable, the “John Lennon hate” trend on TikTok was born. So, why is TikTok Trying To Cancel John Lennon?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=abusing-his-first-wife-and-child><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Abusing His First Wife And Child</span></h2><p>According to letters from some of Lennon’s former housekeepers, Lennon was an incredibly abusive and destructive presence for his first wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia Powell</a>. He was an absentee father most of the time, left drugs in places where their child could reach them, and he would strike his son for every little annoyance, like speaking too loudly or bad table manners. He would also sleep with other women and started his relationship with Yoko Ono while still married to Powell.</p><h2 id=abusing-lsquo-any-woman-rsquo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Abusing ‘Any Woman’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are stories abound from creators on TikTok with jokes lampooning the star for his poor fathering skills, but what is also circulating on TikTok are clips of people summarizing Lennon's infamous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playboy</a> interview where he confessed he had been violent towards women, that he used to beat up ‘any woman’ he felt had crossed him. Clips of Lennon in interviews confessing about his abusive tendencies and the hot takes of feminist TikTok creators now seem endless throughout plenty of users' 'For You' pages on the app.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What John Lennon's Kids Are Up To Today</a></span></p><h2 id=the-jane-mansfield-story><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Jane Mansfield Story</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Videos of a few TikTok creators have begun to share alleged anecdotes about Lennon’s other disgusting habits. One creator tells the story of how one night at a club, Lennon urinated in the beverage of actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jayne Mansfield</a> when she wasn’t looking. Then he watched her take a sip and regurgitate the drink. After Lennon began pointing and laughing, he then fled the club when Mansfield started in on the rock star. Allegedly, Lennon wanted “revenge” against the former Playboy Playmate for rejecting his advances. Considering the fact that Mansfield married Mr. Universe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mickey Hargitay</a>, it’s fair to say that the famously lanky Lennon was not her type.</p><h2 id=problematic-performances-and-songs><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Problematic Performances And Songs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Footage of some of Lennon’s more problematic performances has also begun to circulate on the app as well. In some instances, we see Lennon mocking the disabled and mentally challenged with violent spasms in his performances, and sometimes we see footage of the peace activist making harmful and racist remarks about Asians and black people. A few of the singer's most problematic and offensive songs, particualry one titled "Woman Is The N*gger Of The World" have also begun to go viral on the app.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>John Lennon Hated 'Let It Be'</a></span></p><h2 id=his-abuse-of-yoko-ono><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His Abuse Of Yoko Ono</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Ono does not hold Lennon to a fault for his actions, she has revealed some truths about their relationship that are driving the movement to cancel Lennon. Ono, who was accused of breaking up the Beatles for years, revealed that it was John who was trying to insert Ono into every aspect of the band's life. Lennon allegedly was forcing Ono to forsake her own art to come with him to every Beatles performance and recording session. He even made her go with him to the bathroom. Experts on abusive relationships call this "creating dependency," and the anti-Lennon crowd on TikTok is not having it.</p><h2 id=kids-just-don-rsquo-t-vibe-to-the-beatles-anymore><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kids Just Don’t Vibe To The Beatles Anymore</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One important thing to keep in mind is that kids tend to reject the things that were popular with their elders, sometimes just out of a need to rebel, and other times because they understand things that their elders do not. The point is, times change and the times have significantly changed since Lennon's death in 1980. Many Millenials find it hypocritical that rich white men like the Beatles sing about things like ending war and acceptance of others when their own personal behaviors did not reconcile with that philosophy. It is a hard thing for classic rock fans to accept, but to Generation Z, the Beatles just aren’t cool anymore. They no longer symbolize rebellion to youths, they symbolize conformity and mass consumption. It might be conjecture, but this could also explain the new phenomenon of TikTokers trying to cancel John Lennon. Of course, it is clearly not the only reason.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>John Lennon And Yoko Ono's Complicated Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBuwMikq6ijXZiur6%2FEpaCnn12fvKm6jKWcp6afo3q1tMRmmZ6ZpKGytHnYqKKoZZ%2BjvHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-chelsea-lazkanis-husband-jeff-lazkani.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Selling Sunset': Who Is Chelsea Lazkani's Husband Jeff Lazkani?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-magic-johnsons-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Magic Johnson's Net worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
