After their engine started to splutter and gurgle, they parked their houseboat at a riverbank and tied it to a tree. However, they were given a warning by the Minneapolis park police officer, since it was not allowed to tie a boat to the trees. Following several mishaps and encounters with law enforcement, the houseboat was impounded by the city of Minneapolis. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_7><a href=#>[7]</a></span> However, according to Claire, the incident was exaggerated by the local media. She said,<br><p>We did actually have chickens, but we gave them away because it’s not nice to bring chickens on a boat,” she says. “And then we had some ducks, but they escaped. Ach! I shouldn’t say this. We didn’t have a typewriter, and we weren’t trying to do Huck Finn. The main thing that’s true is the potatoes. We had lots of sacks of potatoes, but that’s not that weird.”</p><p>The adventure has been documented in an animated video narrated by musician and singer T Bone Burnett.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Grimes-and-William-Gratz-on-their-Houseboat.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-56919 class=wp-caption-text>Grimes and William Gratz on their Houseboat</p></li></ul><ul><li>In 2018, Claire was accused by Azealia Banks of allegedly inviting her (Azealia Banks) to Elon Musk’s house for collaboration and failing to show up. She alleged that she had to witness Elon being comforted by Claire for tweeting that ‘he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share.’ Later, Musk filed a lawsuit against Azealia, according to which, plaintiffs sought subpoenas for Grimes, Banks, and three media outlets (the New York Times, Gizmodo, and Business Insider) that interviewed either Banks or Musk about their dispute. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_8><a href=#>[8]</a></span></li></ul><ul><li>Her relationship with Elon Musk has always been a subject of controversy.

She had said,<br><p>I blacked out the windows and did tons of amphetamines and stayed up for three weeks and didn’t eat anything”</p><p>However, she later put a Tumblr post, addressing that there have been edits made to her Wikipedia page that discuss her use of amphetamines during the recording of ‘Visions,’ which are untrue and not supported by her. She added that despite removing it, the sentences are added back on her Wikipedia page multiple times <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_11><a href=#>[11]</a></span> She said,</p><p>losing people to drugs and alcohol is the worst because they destroy any good memories you have of them before forcing you to deal with the empty space they leave behind. also whoever keeps putting the few quotes i said early in my career about drugs back into my wikipedia page is an asshole. I don’t want that to be part of my narrative, and if it has to be I want people to know that i hate hard drugs. All they’ve ever done is kill my friends and cause me to be unproductive. Editing a website that people take seriously and reference all the time so that it looks like i think amphetamines are cool is incredibly irresponsible, people might read that and think its a cool thing to emulate. I hope you know you are doing the world a disservice. I just watched another person I care deeply about basically turn into gollum and my heart is broken.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>In 2020, Elon Musk tweeted ‘Pronouns Suck’ without any additional context.

I think there’s this archetype that exists in Japan that I really identify with, that I don’t think really exists anywhere else – which is the kind of [Hayao] Miyazaki, Nausicaa or Mononoke character. She’s like a young girl who’s very powerful, but is also kind of cute – but it’s not like belittling at all. It’s just not really an archetype that exists in the West, and I love that. You know what I mean, like Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill or something? That kind of character is like my kind of character in reality. I mean, obviously I’m not, like, an assassin, but… I like that, I think that’s really cool.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>She has many tattoos on her body.
