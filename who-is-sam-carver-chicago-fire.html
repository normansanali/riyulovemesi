The latest addition to the team is Sam Carver (Jake Lockett), an overconfident firefighter who replaced <a href=#>Mason Locke (Chris Mansa) after he left Chicago Fire</a>.</p><p>During Season 11, Episode 1, we learn that Carver and Stella go way back. In fact, we find out that the two went to the Academy together and often butted heads. When Chief Boden (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eamonn Walker</a>) brings Sam aboard, Stella can’t hide her disdain over having to work with him.</p><p>Now that they’re reunited, we bet you’re wondering — who is this cocky firefighter from Stella’s past?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carver and Stella were rivals at the Academy.</h2><p>In the Season 11 premiere of Chicago Fire, Stella reveals that she and Carver did not get along during their days at the Academy. When she goes to Chief Boden to raise her concerns, she doesn’t hold back. “With all due respect, he's not 51 material,” she insists.</p><p>Boden disagrees. Despite Stella’s persistent efforts to expose Carver’s arrogance, Boden believes that Stella’s leadership skills are exactly what Carver needs to thrive in Firehouse 51. As a result, Stella tries to make peace with her past nemesis, but the situation quickly sours.</p><p>When Stella informs Carver of her status as <a href=#>Lieutenant</a>, he makes a microaggressive comment reaffirming her initial doubts about his character. <a href=#>Severide</a> (<a href=#>Taylor Kinney</a>) tries to reassure her, but Stella is convinced that Carver hasn’t changed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carver is going to have a significant impact on Stella’s life this season.</h2><p>According to co-showrunners Derek Haas and Andrea Newman, Carver will be anything but a minor character this season. Boden brings him onto the Firehouse 51 team because of his indisputable talent, but that doesn’t mean the character is free of baggage.</p><p>“He's a great firefighter, which is valuable to any rig in our group,” Haas tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Insider</a>. “But it's all the stuff that goes beyond that. How you behave out of the firehouse, off-shift. Who you hang out with. Some of the darker places you end up in. All of this will be affecting Stella."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sam Carver is played by Jake Lockett.</h2><p>If Carver’s face looks familiar, that’s because you might have seen it before. Best known for his role in Capital One Venture X commercials, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Lockett</a> is no stranger to showbiz. In fact, he’s even played minor roles in dramas and sitcoms such as Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Community, Hawaii Five-O, NCIS: Los Angeles, and SEAL Team.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>However, it was Lockett’s performance in Capital One commercials that caught the eyes of showrunners Haas and Newman.</p><p>“We’re just huge fans of his. He brings a lot of presence and gravitas to the role, and he’s also funny,” Newman told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a>. “It’s that rare lightning-in-a-bottle thing we look for on this show because we cross so many different genres, and so if you can do it all, that’s gold.”</p><p>To find out how Firehouse 51’s newest member will affect Stella this season, tune into new episodes of Chicago Fire on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKyZnWKwor7Vnqlmm5iesKKzzmadoqqV</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-and-willie-muse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George And Willie Muse, The Black Brothers Kidnapped By The Circus</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dadazz-the-comedian-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dadazz The Comedian Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
