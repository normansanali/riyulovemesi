Actor and producer Thomas Edward Sizemore Jr. is American. He is well recognized for his supporting parts in films including Heat, Odd Days, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man, Passenger 57, True Romance, and Born on the Fourth of July.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Tom Sizemore wife and making various research about her on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Tom Sizemore wife and everything there is to know about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Tom Sizemore</h2><p>Thomas Edward “Tom” Sizemore, Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, on November 29, 1961. On his maternal side, he has claimed to have French and Native American ancestry.</p><p>Judith, Sizemore’s mother, worked as a public worker. Thomas Edward Sizemore, Sr., his father, was both a lawyer and a philosophy professor. Tom Sizemore was brought up as a Roman Catholic.</p><p>Oliver Stone’s “Born on the Fourth of July,” “Lock Up,” “Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,” and the classic movie “Point Break” are among Sizemore’s earliest film appearances.</p><p>Sizemore built a name for himself early on thanks to his noteworthy roles in these movies, and his performances in movies like “True Romance,” “Natural Born Killers,” and “Strange Days” showcase his early to mid-1990s work. Sizemore also contributed to the world of independent drama, appearing in “Love Is Like That” with actress/model Pamela Gidley.</p><p>Sizemore also played Bat Masterson in Kevin Costner’s “Wyatt Earp,” which earned him a memorable supporting role. For his work in “Heart and Souls,” Sizemore was nominated for a Saturn Award in 1993 for Best Supporting Actor. After making his initial film and television debuts in the late 1980s, Sizemore continued to gain popularity for another ten years by playing intimidating law enforcement officers as well as seedy, swarthy characters.</p><p>After this time, his career entered a very fruitful phase with notable performances as John Gotti in the NBC miniseries “Witness to the Mob” (which aired in 1998) and as a devoted soldier in Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan,” which many moviegoers consider to be among the best World War Two movies ever made.</p><p>Sizemore continued to make appearances in films like “Dreamcatcher” (2003) and “Paparazzi” (2004) as well as on TV shows like “Dr. Vegas” during the 2000s.</p><p>With Ben Affleck, he continued to perform roles that were typical of his early cinematic career in “Pearl Harbor” (2001) and Ridley Scott’s “Black Hawk Down” (2001). Sizemore would also have a successful career as a voice actor, with Sonny Forelli from “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City” standing out as possibly his most recognizable character. Sizemore co-starred with Dennis Hopper and Steven Seagal in the action movie “Ticker” (2001), which was also directed by Albert Pyun.</p><p>Sizemore made one notable TV appearance in 2010, when he joined the cast of “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew” on VH1. This episode focused more on Sizemore’s extracurricular pursuits.</p><p>Sizemore’s life during this time turned out to be more of a disaster than a success. However, he would continue to work in film and television with later projects like the 2011 drama film “Exit Strategy” and the CBS crime drama series “Hawaii Five-O.”</p><p>Is Tom Sizemore married? Not anymore but then he married actress Maeve Quinlan in 1996 and they got divorced in 1999 for reasons linked to his drug problems.</p><p>Tom Sizemore became a father of two when Janelle McIntire welcomed twins.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2mpmWjnsemuc6rnGadqGLEqrLEZqSenaRiuqKx1Z5kqq2Zo7miuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tony-katz-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-kids-wibc-book-podcast-salary-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tony Katz Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Kids, WIBC, Book, Podcast, Salary, and Net Worth.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley-wows-tiny-bikini-rare-photo-baby-daughter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley highlights endless legs in tiny red bikini in rare photo with baby daughte</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
