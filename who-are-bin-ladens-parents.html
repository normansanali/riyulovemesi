Here we detail who they are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000546135222.jpg><h2>Who are Bin Laden's parents?</h2><p><a href=#>Osama Bin Laden</a> was the only child of the marriage between Hamida al-Attas (Alia Ghanem) and Mohammed bin Laden.</p><h3>Mohammed bin Laden</h3><p>Bin Laden’s father was a multi-millionaire <a href=#>Saudi </a>businessman who primarily worked in the construction industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Mohammed - originally poor and uneducated - emigrated from <a href=#>Yemen&nbsp;</a>and founded the Saudi Binladin Group where he became the wealthiest non-royal Saudi.</p><p>He worked as a building contractor for the Saudi royal family during the 1950s, establishing the bin Laden family as intimately connected with the innermost circles of Saudi royalty.</p><p>During his life, he is believed to have married 22 times.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>According to Mohammed, he was planning to wed a 23rd wife the night he died in a plane crash in 1967.</p><p>Upon his passing the patriarch had made a staggering $5billion in the construction industry.</p><p>Osama reportedly inherited around $25–30million.</p><p>He put most of this money into businesses, including banks and cement factories in the <a href=#>United Arab Emirates</a> and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In 2009, Forbes Magazine named the Bin Laden family as the fifth wealthiest in Saudi Arabia.</p><h3>Hamida al-Attas</h3><p>Hamida, born 1943, grew up in <a href=#>Syria </a>as part of a family of citrus farmers.</p><p>At the tender age of just 14, she married Osama’s father Mohamed in 1956 and moved to Saudi Arabia with her husband.</p><p>Records suggest she was either the 10th or 11th wife of the billionaire businessman. &nbsp;</p><p>However, not soon after giving birth to Osama in 1957, she divorced from Mohammed and later married Mohammed al-Attas when her son was four or five.</p><p>The couple went on to have three sons and a daughter, including Ahmad Mohammed, and a young Bin Laden took an active part in raising his half siblings.</p><p>And despite the evil path that he would eventually take, including his lead role in the <a href=#>9/11</a> terrorist attacks of 2001, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">remains in “denial”</a>&nbsp;about her mass murdering son.</p><p>During a 2018 interview with <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, she called the former <a href=#>Al Qaeda</a> leader a “very good kid" who "loved me so much.”</p><h2>Who are Osama bin Laden's siblings?</h2><p>Osama was Mohammed's 17th child and had 53 half and full siblings.</p><p>Some of the most notable are:</p><h3>Salem bin Laden</h3><p>His eldest brother, Salem bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, was nine years his senior.</p><p>The Saudi Arabian investor and businessman was a half brother, related to Osama through his father.</p><p>Salem died at the age of 42 in 1988.</p><h3>Bakr bin Laden</h3><p>Osama's second-oldest brother&nbsp;<a href=#>Bakr bin Laden</a>, also a successful businesses man, was the former chairman of construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.</p><p>He was arrested in Saudi Arabia’s anti-corruption campaign and was released&nbsp;15 months later in January 2019.</p><h3>Yeslam bin Laden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000002605285.jpg><p>Yeslam is the half-brother of Osama Bin Laden as has lived in Switzerland since the mid 1980s.</p><p>He is multi-lingual and can speak a number of languages including Arabic, English, French and Persian.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontline</a>, Yeslam has been the chairman of the&nbsp;Swiss-based&nbsp;Saudi investment company which represents his family's international financial interests.</p><h3>Tarek bin Laden</h3><p>Tarek&nbsp;is another half-brother of Osama and a member of the Saudi Arabia&nbsp;business community.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He started a textile business with Swedish actor Kjell Bergvist, before it fell through due to the factories “poor design.”</p><p>At the time of writing, Tarek is believed to be the chairman of the Middle East Development LLC, a Dubai-based company.</p><span
