His theater, in Los Feliz, Ca is scheduled to reopen in November 2023, which is a small, yet steady source of income for the director. Tarantino has also been giving back by visiting Israeli army bases to "boost morale" amongst the troops.

But earning $120 million was never what Quentin set out to achieve. He wanted to make movies. The money was just a great bonus and something that really ingratiated him with numerous producers and studios. This is because many of his early films (such as Jackie Brown) were made on a shoestring budget and raked in a fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino Laughed Off Booing From The Audience After His Best Film Won At Cannes</a></span></p><p>His later and more expensive films also had impressive box-office returns, such as his <strong>Kill Bill films which collectively earned $335 million</strong>, or <strong>Django Unchained which, alone, earned $425 million</strong>.</p><p>Quentin's box-office stats, as well as his reputation, is what allows him to ask for about $20 million to write, direct, and produce each of his movies.

The man, after all, is a film purest.</p><p>Tarantino never shoots on digital cameras and he adores movie theaters. He even went to war with Disney over the use of one specific movie theater in Los Angeles. But while Tarantino has some emotional connections to various landmark movie theaters across The United States, he also owns a couple of them.</p><p>In July 2021, Quentin shelled out an unknown sum of money <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to purchase Los Angeles' Vista Theater</a>. Unsurprisingly, this is a movie theater that Quentin had an emotional connection with and also one that he featured in True Romance, a 1993 Tony Scott film that Quentin wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino Wasn't Impressed With Jamie Foxx (At First)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview on Dax Shephard's Armchair Podcast</a>, Quentin claimed that he bought the historic movie theater which is located on the Sunset Strip. True to form, Quentin, claimed that the movie theater will only show movies in film format and not digital, not unlike the other movie theater he owns...</p><p>"Weâ€™ll probably open [The Vista Theater] around Christmas time," Quentin explained. "And again: only film. It wonâ€™t be a revival house. Weâ€™ll show new movies that come out where they give us a film print," Quentin told Dax. "Itâ€™s not going to be like the New Beverly. The New Beverly has its own vibe."</p><p>Both L.A.-based theaters, The Vista and The New Beverly (which Quentin purchased in 2007) have been closed due to the global pandemic. Quentin is currently in the process of spending money to revamp and reopen the movie theaters to preserve the theater-going experience that he values oh so much. The current anticipated reopen date is November 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quentin-tarantino-spends-money-on-classic-cars>Quentin Tarantino Spends Money On Classic Cars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar50789788-1-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Tarantino uses his classic cars in his films</strong></li></ul><p>Although Quentin is surprisingly quiet about how he spends his money, it is known that he has numerous vintage cars, some of which were featured in his movies, such as the **ssy Wagon from Kill Bill and the Chevrolet 1964 Chevelle Malibu from Pulp Fiction.</p><p>Other classic cars that Quentin owns, accoring to Way.com that have appeared in his films include:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Chevrolet Nova</p></td><td><p>1974</p></td><td><p>Pulp Fiction</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Volkswagon Karmann Ghia</p></td><td><p>Unknown year</p></td><td><p>Kill Bill Vol. 2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cadillac Coupe DeVille</p></td><td><p>1966</p></td><td><p>Reservoir Dogs and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS Convertable</p></td><td><p>1964</p></td><td><p>Pulp Fiction</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chevrolet C-2500 Silverado</p></td><td><p>1997</p></td><td><p>Kill Bill Vol. 1</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all of these cars to choose from, it is no wonder that so many of Quentin's films have a feeling of realism and nostalgia combined.</p><h2 id=quentin-tarantino-spends-his-money-on-properties>Quentin Tarantino Spends His Money On Properties</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar52771640-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Tarantino splits time between Israel and Los Angeles</strong></li></ul><p>Quentin has been pretty cagey about the luxury properties that he owns, although he has described his house when talking about how he writes his movies. Usually, he's writing scripts by hand on the terrace off his bedroom that overlooks his pool and the Hollywood Hills. This is the same house that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ransacked by burglars in 2019</a>. <strong>It's also the very same house where Quentin made Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Margot Robbie come to read Once Upon A Time In Hollywood before offering them the parts.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Velvet Tropes, Quentin purchased the 8,733-square-foot, 8-bedroom home for $3 million back in 1996.
