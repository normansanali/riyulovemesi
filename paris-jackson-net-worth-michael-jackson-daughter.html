The 23-year-old has been finding her feet in the music and film industries. She released her debut album Wilted in November last year, and has appeared in a number of movies, TV shows, and music videos over the course of her career, including recent movie Habit alongside <strong>Bella Thorne</strong> and <strong>Gavin Rossdale</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Michael Jackson's Son Urges World Leaders To Address Climate Change</a></span></p><p>Paris, 23, is the second child of her father and <strong>Debbie Rowe</strong>, alongside elder brother <strong>Michael Joseph 'Prince' Jackson </strong>and younger half-brother <strong>Prince Michael</strong> (commonly known as 'Blanket'). Following her father's untimely death in 2009, Jackson was brought up by her paternal grandmother, and has since struggled with fame and the pressures of her public persona - having battled a number of personal demons.</p><p>Her combination of inheritances and personal career success has made Paris a very wealthy individual. But how much is she worth, exactly?</p><h2 id=how-much-was-her-dad-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Was Her Dad Worth?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of Paris's enormous personal fortune may be attributed to her father, Michael, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whose illustrious career as an entertainer, despite enormous success, actually had a NEGATIVE $500 million value at the time of his death</a>. Jackson's years of expensive living, court cases, and the costs of running his lavish Neverland ranch, resulted in a shocking state of affairs for the singer - who was forced to plan a return to touring during the lead up to his death and borrow against his billion-dollar music catalogue in order to claw back much-needed funds.</p><p>Despite these significant debts, however, the star's estate still rakes in millions annually from royalties and other commerical interests. Executors of the Jackson estate have overseen an almost complete reversal of fortunes - as his legacy continues to generate massive funds - reportedly over $700 million in the years since his death - raking in enormous amounts from music royalties, merchandise, and earnings from his This is It movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-paris-and-her-siblings-receive-an-allowance><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Do Paris And Her Siblings Receive An Allowance?</span></h2><p>The answer to that question is yes, and a sizeable one at that. According to Page Six,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the Jackson children receive an astonishing $8 million annually from their father's estate</a>. Since his death, each child has also received the best schooling and personal care (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including a health stay for Paris to help her emotional recovery</a>).</p><p>Though the children each enjoy the ocassional splurge, they are generally sensible with the enormous amounts left to them and each has a strong work ethic. Paris's elder brother Michael is reportedly saving hard in order to purchase their father's old Neverland estate and return it to its former glory and has big plans for the park's future as a resort for Jackson fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-are-they-still-to-inherit><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Are They Still To Inherit?</span></h2><p>In addition to their annual allowance, Paris and her two brothers are also in line to inherit a huge lump sum on reaching the age of 33, when each will inherit an equal portion of half of their father's estate - which is now estimated to be in the very healthy region of $2 billion under the careful management of creditors.</p><p>Jackson was careful to ensure that each child learned to manage a smaller personal fortune before attaining their true share of his estate. At the mature age of 40, the children will inherit the rest of the estate. As such, Paris is an heiress to many hundreds of millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-her-personal-earnings><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Are Her Personal Earnings?</span></h2><p>In addition to her healthy income from her father's estate, Paris also has had several successful ventures in film, TV, modelling, and music. She signed with IMG models in 2017, and since then has had a number of important contracts. She's also made big money appearing in a number of films, including Gringo and The Space Between.</p><p>Income from her various music efforts has also been sizeable. Her band, The Soundflowers, released an EP last year, and she has also released her own solo album with Republic Records, featuring lead single 'Let Down.'</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Michael Jackson Went Broke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-her-assets><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Are Her Assets?</span></h2><p>In addition to her fortune, Paris also has a number of personal assets with a huge value. She owns an expensive home which is situated in Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles. The house has been dubbed a 'hippy haven' by media; Paris regularly invites friends to live with her in the secluded home, which gives ample privacy for the star to enjoy her lifestyle privately. Paris frequently posts about their shenanigans on her Instagram page.</p><h2 id=what-is-her-total-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Her Total Net Worth?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking into account Paris's inheritances, allowances, and personal ventures, her total net worth is estimated to be around $100 million. This value may only be a conservative estimate of the true figure, however, and will swell to several times this size over the coming decades as she and her brothers gain greater access and control of the funds from her late father's vast estate.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Why Michael Jackson Tried To Stop Thriller's Release</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmqqZqHqrrcKkqqimXaOytXnWqKmtoF2itqS0wJ6jZqKRmLi0u81mm5qtl53Bpr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bob-mummert-obituary-nashville-tn-drummer-musician-has-sadly-passed-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tom Emmer, the Republican nominee for speaker of the House from Minnesota who pulled out hour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./akhenaten-kihwa-t-snipes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wesley Snipes Wife Nakyung Park Painter And A Mother Of Four</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
