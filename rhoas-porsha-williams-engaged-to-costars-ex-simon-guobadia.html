He makes me so happy and to me, that is what matters most.”</p><p>A few hours later, Simon, 56, <a href=#>announced the pair’s engagement</a> via Instagram. “I’d like to seize this opportunity to thank every well wisher of Porsha and I, whether via phone, text or DM,” he wrote early on Tuesday, May 11. “You affirm my [belief] that finding love is possible for everyone who genuinely seeks one. Getting married again was never a question in my mind, but when. Did not expect to be blessed with a mate so soon. The interesting thing about life is that it is an individual journey.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Porsha-Williams-Engaged-to-RHOA-Costar-Falynn-Guobadia-Estranged-Husband-Simon-Guobadia-2.jpg><p>The film producer also shared a photo of <a href=#>Williams’ large engagement ring</a>. “We travel this road not lightly considering we have being in relationships that have thought us to want and do better for ourselves,” he continued. “I asked her to marry me because we checked ALL of each other’s boxes, and then some.
