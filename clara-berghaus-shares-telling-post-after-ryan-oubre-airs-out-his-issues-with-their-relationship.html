Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip about you. Their opinions aren’t your problem. You stay kind, committed to love, and free in your authenticity. No matter what they do or say don’t you dare doubt your worth or the beauty of your truth. Just keep on shining like you do.”&nbsp;</p><p>Clara also wrote her own words, saying, “Blessed to be closing out this year without an ounce of anger in my heart. Closer to my family than I’ve ever been. And wildly, unconditionally loved by the people who matter.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/clara-IG-story-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ryan and Clara both felt blindsided&nbsp;</h2><p>When news broke of Ryan and Clara’s divorce, many MAFS viewers were shocked, not because they thought Ryan and Clara were a good match, but because the pair had just done a revealing interview as a married couple and were <a href=#>in the midst of planning a vow renewal.&nbsp;</a></p><p>After the divorce, Clara posted several messages and comments that suggested she was blindsided by the divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>In Ryan’s recent post where he broke his silence on their relationship, Ryan felt blindsided in another way. Ryan essentially expressed feeling blindsided by Clara <a href=#>capitalizing off the issues in their relationship for monetary gain.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Interestingly, Ryan also recently shared a telling quote of his own to his Instagram stories.&nbsp;</p><p>The quote from Alchemic Healing read, “Somebody is mad at you right now because you picked peace over drama and distance over disrespect.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ryan-oubre-IG-story.jpg><p>It seems Clara and Ryan have both continued to use social media as a way to express their thoughts on the relationship and their MAFS experience in general and it remains to be seen if they’ll continue to publicly address the relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Married at First Sight premieres Wednesday, January 5th at 8/7c on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5OhrrOtjJucq5%2BYlsK0edKhmKudo2LBprjLoqWgZaCkwLV5wJ%2Brnqpdp8aiuoyorJuqlWKuqr7SZqaurF2dtrR5yKyqrp2jYsSqwMdmq6Gdmad6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dae-dae-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-407382-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dae Dae Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./binge-watching-rupauls-drag-race-just-got-a-lot-easier-with-the-new-drag-race-universe-channel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Binge-watching RuPauls Drag Race just got a lot easier with the new Drag Race Universe channel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
