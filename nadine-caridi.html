Her marriage to Jordan Belfort made her a well-known figure in the 1990s; their relationship was tumultuous and ended in divorce. Cardi went on to pursue a career in psychology and earned a Ph.D. Later marriages and divorces have kept her in the public eye, but she has largely stayed out of the spotlight in recent years.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=childhood-and-early-life><span id=Childhood_and_Early_Life><strong>Childhood and Early Life</strong></span></h3><p>Nadine, also known as the Duchess of Bay Ridge, was born in London, England, on November 6, 1962. Caridi’s parents transferred her to Brooklyn, New York, as a child, and she spent the rest of her life there. We know little about Nadine’s parents because she rarely talks about them.</p><p>Furthermore, Nadine Caridi attended Brooklyn’s John Dewey High School when it came to her educational history. She received her Somatic Psychotherapy degree from Pacifica Graduate Institute and earned a master’s degree in clinical psychology. In 2015, she did her PhD.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nadine-Caridi-Age.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=professional-career><span id=Professional_Career><strong>Professional Career</strong></span></h3><p>Nadine Caridi’s modelling career began when she was chosen as the face of Miller Lite beer when she was young. She got increasingly renowned after that, at least in the fashion and modelling worlds. She later featured in several national advertisements, but she wasn’t quite as well-known as she became after an affair with Jordan Belfort, a prominent stock dealer. Similarly, Nadine co-starred in the 2013 film ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ alongside Margot Robbie.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=relationship-status><span id=Relationship_Status><strong>Relationship Status</strong></span></h3><p>Jordan was introduced to her by her boyfriend, Alan Wilzig, during one of his parties. They met at a party and were immediately drawn to one other. They have two kids: Chandler, a daughter, and Carter, a son. Due to Belfort’s troubles with substance misuse, fraud, and extramarital affairs, they divorced in 2005. Jordan was sentenced to 22 months in jail for his wrongdoings.</p><p>&nbsp;All this time, Belfort had been married to Denise Lombardo, his high school sweetheart. However, after both divorced, Jordan married Caridi in 1991. They had a beautiful wedding in the Caribbean. Nadine is married to John Macaluso, a businessman whom she married a year after her divorce.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=height-weight-and-physical-appearances><span id=Height_Weight_and_Physical_Appearances><strong>Height, Weight, and Physical Appearances</strong></span></h3><p>This stunning model and actress is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs roughly 55 kg.

Similarly, her acting job was her principal source of income. In terms of her net worth, she is estimated to be worth roughly $6 million, which is mouth-watering. However, there is no information in the media concerning her asset valuations.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=social-media><span id=Social_Media><strong>Social Media</strong></span></h3><p>In terms of her social media presence, Nadine is active on some of the platforms.
