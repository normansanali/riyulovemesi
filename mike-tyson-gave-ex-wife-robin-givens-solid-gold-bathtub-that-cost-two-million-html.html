Mostly, they were due to a rape accusation and conviction, his temper, his jealousy over his wives, and his financial woes.</p><p id=par-3_30>The truth is lavish spending was a huge part of Tyson’s life. He came from a background that didn’t allow it and embraced it fully when he had the chance.</p><h2 id=h-the-price-of-luxury-how-much-did-the-high-life-cost-mike-tyson>The price of luxury: how much did the high life cost Mike Tyson?</h2><p id=par-4_48>Though Tyson didn’t come from money, he certainly knew what to do with it when he found it. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Post</a>, some estimates are that he spent around “$4.5 million on cars and motorcycles, $3.4 million on clothes and jewelry, and $7.8 million on personal expenses.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_41>For a while, it seems as though no price was too high for Tyson. He spent a fortune on two white <a href=#>Bengal tigers</a> and their trainer. The big cats cost $140,000 and then their trainer was another $125,000 each year.</p><p id=par-6_27>However, this was nothing compared to the bathtub that he purchased for his first wife, <a href=#>Robin Givens</a>, and a birthday party for her that totaled around $410,000.</p><p id=par-7_36>It was a bathtub that he ended up keeping when the two divorced, but eventually, Tyson parted with it. He sold it to a British billionaire for around half the price that he paid for it.</p><h2 id=h-the-story-behind-tyson-robin-givens-and-the-bathtub-between-them>The story behind Tyson, Robin Givens, and the bathtub between them</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_36>Tyson married Givens in 1988 and the two <a href=#>divorced in 1989</a>. Although Tyson’s autobiography says that Givens was a good step for him, she filed for a divorce claiming that Tyson was abusive and jealous.</p><p id=par-9_21>Perhaps the jealousy had cause, as Tyson claimed that he walked in on an intimate moment between Givens and Brad Pitt.</p><p id=par-10_23>It has been said that the two had a very rocky relationship from the start. Therefore, the two never had kids together.</p><p id=par-11_37>The kids did not come for Tyson until his second rocky marriage to Monica Turner in 1997. With <a href=#>Turner, two kids</a> were born, but it ultimately ended in divorce after she claimed that Tyson cheated on her.</p><h2 id=h-where-are-givens-and-tyson-today>Where are Givens and Tyson today?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_32>Givens is doing well, but she is staying under the radar, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>. Though there are rumors that she received a $10 million settlement during her divorce, she denies it.</p><p id=par-13_36>Because of this, it is estimated that her net worth is only around $1 to $3 million. However, it may change since the actor released her newest movie Saints & Sinners: Judgment Day in February 2021.</p><p id=par-14_26>After her divorce from Tyson, she remarried in 1997 to <a href=#>Svetozar Marinkovic</a>, but it was also short-lived. The two divorced in 1998. She has two children.</p><p id=par-15_35>Tyson would eventually get his world worked out, and he married his third wife, Lakiha “Kiki” Spicer, in 2009. They have two kids. He recently developed, with her help, a Broadway show, The Undisputed Truth.</p><p id=par-16_43>At one time, it was estimated that Tyson amassed approximately $300 million, but that was before his troubles really began. Today, it is estimated that his net worth is around $3 million, which isn’t bad considering he lost it all at one time.</p><p id=par-17_16><strong>Related: <a href=#>Mike Tyson Owed $60 Million In Debt—Here’s His Secret to How He Turned Things Around</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qrfEZquyq5%2Bjeqit1Z5knrBdrLansYyrppuhnmK0qsLEp6pmq5%2BhtqV5xqijnWWSlsGpwNSbZK2gkal6pLvSrWStr59iuqq4y6Kmp2aYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./missniylanicole.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MissNiylaNicole- Age, Bio, Wiki, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelsea-ballerini-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelsea Ballerini Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
