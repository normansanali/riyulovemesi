Trading in the vast fields and strict rules of their rural communities for the endless beaches and blistering sunshine of Los Angeles, these young men and women come together to determine if they’re really ready to embark on a new life among the “English,” or if they should return to the faiths and families they’ve left behind.</p><p>The 10-part series BREAKING AMISH: LA premieres Sunday, July 21 at 10/9c.</p><p>“BREAKING AMISH is about the challenges and opportunities anyone faces when at a crossroads in life – deciding which path to take and finding your road to happiness. With an all-new cast and a different, vibrant city, BREAKING AMISH: LA opens the door to these fascinating lives and the journeys they all embark on, as they explore this new world in search of who they want to be – at the risk of everything they’ve ever had,” said Amy Winter, General Manager, TLC.</p><p>This season features brighter skies – and darker secrets – as the cast leave their homes and venture west to live together under one roof, experiencing a lot of ‘firsts’ along the way. Though they share similar backgrounds, they find their lives to be very different, and must not only work to adjust to a new city, but to each other as well. Their entire lives are at stake, as their family, faith, and COMMUNITY may reject them completely based on the decision to venture west.</p><p style=text-align:center>* * * * * * * * *</p><p>If anyone out there knows any of the cast members (including their last names) we’d love to know more about them!
