Battling it out for a £100,000 prize, all the contestants had to help them last as long as possible in the middle of nowhere was a handful of tools and their will to survive. So, who won Alone UK?</strong></p><p>In the USA, TV show <a href=#>Alone</a> has been running for 10 seasons. In 2023, the show was adapted for UK viewers and it’s had many people hooked. The show’s first UK series kicked off on August 6 at 9pm and came to an end on Sunday, September 10. Reality Titbit caught up with the Alone 2023 winner to find out how it felt to be the last one standing on the Channel 4 show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/72dpi_73983_6_S1_Ep6_Alone-S1-Ep6-11-1024x576.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-alone-channel-4-winner>Who is the Alone Channel 4 winner?</h2><p>The <a href=#>Channel 4</a> Alone winner was revealed as Tom Williams during the show’s final episode airing on September 10.</p><p>Tom and Elise both made it to the very end of the show, but Elise tapped out of the competition on Day 33.</p><p>Thirty-nine-year-old Tom is the last person standing on Day 34 and receives a phone call to tell him the news in episode 6.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Am I the only one enjoying the survival programme Alone?</p><p>Makes me wanna give it a go! 😂<a href=#>#Alone</a> <a href=#>#survival</a> <a href=#>#Channel4</a></p>— Keiran D (@K_Dunnwrenn) <a href=#>September 6, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-s-reaction-to-winning>Tom’s reaction to winning</h2><p>Speaking to Reality Titbit, Alone winner Tom described how he felt when he was told he had won the show.</p><p>He said: “Complete shock, absolute shock. I was actually concerned. I didn’t expect to win after just 34 days and so I was really terrified that something had happened with my family and so there was actually tremendous relief that my family was fine.”</p><p>A huge fan of the TV show himself, Tom said he was ready to go 65 days in the wilderness, but he said “suddenly it was done” after just 34.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-chipping-away-at-imposter-syndrome>He’s ‘chipping away’ at imposter syndrome</h2><p>Following Tom’s “momentous achievement” of winning Alone, he said that he is “chipping away” at his Imposter Syndrome and he feels “more confident” and “proud” of himself.</p><p>The Alone winner has previously done expeditions in his life, including walking to the North Pole. He told Reality Titbit, that getting out of your comfort zone “forces you to grow as a person.”</p><p>Tom added that he also felt a lot of happiness during his experience in the Canadian wilderness.

The show’s winner said that he would have been burning around 4000 calories a day.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>CATCH UP WITH ALONE ON THE ALL4 PLAYER</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLWius2eo2ZsX5a5sLrEZpqhmZ6jsq15k2auoqaemr9uuM6sq2aZnKK8tMCMrZ%2BrnZViwLW7zZ5krK2iq7a3tc2gZK2glWKworrAnaCapl2stq2wxKulnquj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrew-wiggins-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrew Wiggins Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whataburger-pay-stub-login.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whataburger Pay Stub Login 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
