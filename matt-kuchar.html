Lather, chose to go to the Georgia Institute of Technology and enrolled in their golf program.</p><p>Matt was a two-time first-team All-American during his college career with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. He also has a bachelor’s degree in business administration.</p><p>He won the 1997 U.S. Amateur championship as an amateur after losing the 1996 event in the semi-finals to Tiger Woods.</p><h2><span id=Matt_Kuchar_8211_Professional_career>Matt Kuchar – Professional career</span></h2><p>He began working in a financial services firm before pursuing a career as a professional golfer in 2000.&nbsp; However, due to a decision-making error, he missed the 2000 qualifying school sign-up date.</p><p>As a result, he waited and applied again the next year. As a result, he secured sponsor’s exemptions to a few PGA Tour events, where he earned enough money to be fully available for the 2002 season</p><p>. In addition, he won his first PGA Tour event, the Honda Classic, in 2005.</p><p>However, as a professional, he was unable to move above the average. As a result, the golfer won less than $403,000 in 2005, placing him 159th on the money list.</p><p>He lost his tour card as a result of his drop in the rankings and was unable to regain it at qualifying school.</p><p>On that basis, he chose to compete on the Nationwide Tour in 2006, when he finished ninth on the money list.</p><p>As a result, he regained his PGA Tour card for the 2007 season, finishing 115th on the money list, and extended his card for the 2008 season. Furthermore, he has substantially improved his game, ranking 70th on the 2008 PGA money list.</p><p>Seven years after his first PGA Tour win, he won his second at the 2009 Turning Stone Resort Championship. As a result, he qualified for the Ryder Cup team in 2010.<br>Despite their best efforts, the team was unable to take the trophy. Matt, on the other hand, gained a lot of experience, which was reflected in his PGA Tour performance,</p><p>as he led the tour in top-10 finishes for the year. Despite this, he was unable to secure a victory in the competition that year. Nonetheless, in 2010, the rising golfer won the Vardon, Byron Nelson, and Arnold Palmer Trophies.</p><h4>Number five in the world ranking</h4><p>He won his first major tournament in 2012 at TPC Sawgrass, where he took home The Players Championship. As a result, the victory boosted him to a career-high ranking of fifth in the world.</p><p>In addition, he continued his winning streak the following season by winning the WGC-Accenture Match Play and Memorial Tournament Championships.</p><p>Similarly, he finished fourth in the 2013 World Cup of Golf. Nonetheless, he went undefeated in professional tournaments during the 2014 and 2015 seasons.</p><p>A significant success came for him in the 2016 Summer Olympics, when he earned bronze for his country.</p><p>He was selected as a non-playing vice-captain for the United States team in the 2018 Ryder Cup, which the Americans lost to the Europeans. He also won the Mayakoba Golf Classic, for which he received $1.296 million.</p><h4>latest career</h4><p>He went on to win the 2019 Sony Open in Hawaii after a great 2018 season. Similarly, he reached the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play finals for the second time in his career.</p><p>Unlike the previous time, he was unable to capitalize and was defeated by Kevin Kisner. He also qualified for the 2019 U.S. Presidents Cup team, which will compete at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club in Australia.</p><p>As a result, the United States team won dramatically, coming back from a three-point deficit against Louis Oosthuizen.</p><h2><span id=Matt_Kuchar_8211_Body_measurements>Matt Kuchar – Body measurements</span></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200330 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Matt-Kuchar-body-measurements.jpg alt="Matt Kuchar" width=650 height=866 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200330 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Matt Kuchar was captured playing golf(Source: Golf Digest)</p><p>Matt is<strong> 6 feet 4 inches</strong> tall and weighs around 88 kg.
