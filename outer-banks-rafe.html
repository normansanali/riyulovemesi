Rafe left college early and returned to his family’s Outer Banks home to work the family company. Rafe felt like he could get away with murder because his family was one of the richest in the Outer Banks and he felt entitled to it.</p><p>Rafe’s fears about his father were the only reason of this small North Carolina town’s demise. Even though he was responsible for some very heinous atrocities, what actually happened was a web of lies to protect his reputation. The most of the horrible actions seem to have been planned by Rafe’s father, Ward, although Rafe is really the bad guy.</p><h3>For Starters, He Shot Officer Peterkin</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/For-Starters-He-Shot-Officer-Peterkin-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>When it came to his interactions with Rafe’s sister, Sarah, many viewers thought that Topper was the villain in Outer Banks, but Rafe outdid Topper in terms of his wicked behaviour. And it all began when he made an effort to gain his father’s approval.</p><p>Rafe believed he had lost his father’s esteem as a result of being discovered abusing narcotics. He therefore believed that the only way to demonstrate his commitment to his dad was to kill Sheriff Peterkin and place the blame on John B. when he learned that Sheriff Peterkin was preparing to detain his dad for the murder of John B. Sr. The fact that Rafe didn’t appear to regret his choice or exhibit any sorrow for taking a life should have made fans recognise that this was merely the start of his wicked path.</p><h3>He Attacked JJ At The Country Club<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/He-Attacked-JJ-At-The-Country-Club-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Rafe did not get along with JJ, a local Pogue, since he was a Kook who was chasing his closest friend, John B. Although JJ and Rafe hated one another, their problems with their fathers were identical, and this was known to the locals on the Outer Banks.</p><p>The two clashed in “Midsummers” while JJ was working the Midsummers party when Rafe leaped on him. Rafe and the Kooks were able to see JJ despite her attempts to hide by running throughout the country club. In the locker area, the group attacked JJ, leaving him badly bruised. Rafe once more demonstrated his lack of concern for the repercussions of his actions by choosing to threaten JJ with violence (further emphasising what a dangerous individual he was becoming).</p><h3>He Did Everything He Could To Get John B. Arrested<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/He-Did-Everything-He-Could-To-Get-John-B.-Arrested-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>After Rafe killed Sherrif Peterkin, Ward realised he needed to prevent his son from being detained on suspicion of murder. Ward claimed that John B. was the one who shot and killed Peterkin, rather than informing the authorities what actually transpired.</p><p>Rafe agreed to the deception and assisted the police in their search for John B. after seeing that his father stood up for his reputation. Given that Rafe was the real killer, it was perverse of him to continue spreading the myth that John B. committed the crime.</p><h3>He Had Zero Respect For Wheezie<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/He-Had-Zero-Respect-For-Wheezie-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The eldest sister of Rafe is Wheezie. Wheezie was too young—13—to comprehend the gravity of the situation involving her father, brother, and sister. However, she was very intelligent and knew that her brother was turning to the bad side because she is such an inquisitive person.</p><p>Sadly, Rafe took Wheezie’s phone and pretended to be Wheezie in order to contact Sarah while she was waiting to hear from her after worrying for her safety. Additionally, Wheezie is treated disrespectfully by Rafe, who also dismisses her. He was undoubtedly headed to becoming the biggest antagonist the programme had ever seen given his capacity for being so cunning, cunning, and rude towards his loved ones.</p><h3>He Tried Killing His Sister… Twice<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/He-Tried-Killing-His-Sister...-Twice-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>The Kooks and the Pogues are two bands with a lengthy history in the Outer Banks that focus on the social standing of the wealthy and the middle class, respectively. Since of their enormous riches, Sarah, Rafe, and the Cameron family were regarded as kooks, whilst John B. and his pals were regarded as pogues because they had to work to support themselves.</p><p>Rafe was furious when Sarah decided the Kook lifestyle was not for her and began hanging out with the Pogues. He detested the fact that his sister sided with John B., a Pogue, rather than their own. Rafe tried to drown Sarah after realising that she would lie to the police about him. Later in the series, as she attempted to defend John B., he shot her. Rafe was solely concerned about himself, as evidenced by the fact that he didn’t even care that he had injured his sister (despite claiming he wanted to take care of her).</p><h3>He Was Needlessly Violent Towards Pope<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/He-Was-Needlessly-Violent-Towards-Pope-1024x512.jpg alt width=1024 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Pope is a Pogue who carries himself well. His diligent parents support him and want him to attend college. Early in the series, Pogue concentrated on getting a scholarship because going to college was his main objective. But the Kooks made his life difficult.</p><p>In one incident, Pope was being chased by Rafe and Topper while carrying bags of food and beer through the golf course. Pope was helpless and only wanted to get home. Fans found the scene sad because Rafe started the whole thing. The fact that he struck Pope with a golf club and caused serious injuries, including blood loss and bruises, was concerning. Who knows how much further he would have travelled if Topper hadn’t been there?</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
