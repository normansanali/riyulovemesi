The singer-songwriter was devastated after trying out for the TV show, knowing the moment she auditioned that she wouldn’t get the part.

Before her final audition, the potential cast members hung out at camp for two weeks to determine their chemistry as a group. As a result, she became extremely good friends with the cast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/jessica-simpson-1.jpg><p id=par-4_16>Simpson reveals in her book that her hopes were extremely high that she would make it.</p><p id=par-5_84>“There were eleven of us, and the term ‘Top Eight’ became the Holy Grail,” she writes. “Throughout my time at camp, my parents kept hearing, ‘She’s going to make it. She’s our Top Eight.’ At one point, Matt Casella (the casting director) came up to me and my parents. ‘Jessica, it looks really positive,’ he said. It was one thing for my parents to think I had talent, but these professionals were now telling them their daughter had the potential to be a star.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justin-timberlake-made-jessica-simpson-cry-after-her-failed-audition>Justin Timberlake made Jessica Simpson cry after her failed audition</h2><p id=par-6_37>According to Simpson, she was incredibly nervous about her Mickey Mouse Club audition. She was set to sing for the casting crew after Christina Aguilera, and she felt like it would be an impossible act to follow.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>The color pink represents compassion, nurturing & love.

Just typing this now, I am like, ‘Here we go. Cue the crash.”</p><p id=par-8_41>As Simpson tells it, she “just froze” on stage. “My choreography was completely off, and then I couldn’t remember any of the lines from my monologue. I stared at the camera and knew I’d blown it completely. The theater was silent.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-9_20>She then ran off stage, trying not to cry. Timberlake, who was about to go on, fed into her insecurities.</p><p id=par-10_19>“‘Oooooooooh,’ Justin said, his eyes so wide, his mouth open like a slack-jawed cartoon. ‘What did you just do?'”</p><p id=par-11_40>“That started the tears,” Simpson writes. “Oh, I cried. I cried big heaving sobs. My parents came to me, asking again and again, ‘What happened? What Happened?’ I choked. I crashed down to earth, landing right on top of them.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jessica-simpson-remained-friends-with-the-mouseketeers-later-on-in-life>Jessica Simpson remained friends with the ‘Mouseketeers’ later on in life</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-12_45>Because she became so close with the other cast members, she was all the more crushed when she didn’t get the part. “I had grown so close to these people,” she writes, “and I thought we were all going to be on an adventure together.”</p><p id=par-13_22>Fortunately, though, Simpson was able to find success as an artist on her own without the help of the variety series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3tr%2FToqVmrJmir6a%2By5qinmWdlrGmecmeqqyhk5Z6tLXMqaqopl2ovKN5wJ%2BrnqpdnbKzecCum6KsmaS7brLOq2StoJViuqqvyp6wZqWfqsCmecKlrJtmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-kuzma-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kyle Kuzma Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenni-pulos-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenni Pulos Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
