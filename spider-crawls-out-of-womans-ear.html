She captioned the now-viral clip with, "First TikTok post and it couldn't be a better one. My mom felt something moving in her ear and well...." throwing in a crying face emoji and a nauseated face emoji in the caption for good measure.</p><p>Her mom had been complaining of strange pain in her ear, so her daughter poured hydrogen peroxide in her mom's ear canal, assuming that it was just earwax or something innocuous.</p><p>Naturally, mother and daughter were horrified to discover a spider crawl out of the mom's ear!

So is it common or rare for a spider to crawl in someone's ear at night?</p><p>According to a report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Self</a>, while it isn't common for bugs in general to crawl in one's ear at night (you can breathe a sigh of relief now, it's OK), it isn't completely uncommon.</p><p>In other words, while you shouldn't live in fear of going to bed at night, it's not entirely impossible that a spider might try to find a home in your ear canal, although it's typically unlikely.</p><p>If you do find a critter in your ear, the Self report notes that it is not wise to use a Q-tip to try to get it out. Try mineral oil or baby oil instead, and then get checked out by a doctor just to make sure your ear is OK ... and your peace of mind, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL2qsMSrZJyqkay5tHnOrqtmp5ZixLC5wKeqZp2Rpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./agatha-christie-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Agatha Christie Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-galifianakis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Zach Galifianakis?
