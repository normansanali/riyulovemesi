His coaching career spanned over four decades with different universities and NFL teams. For instance, he served as Houston Texans’ head coach for the 2021 season.</p><p>We can all agree that an NFL coach has a hectic job with lots of travel involved. So, it’s hard for us to visualize Culley as a family man, considering his active lifestyle. But, he has defied the odds by being a loving husband to his spouse and doting father to his children.</p><p>David Culley’s wife, <strong>Carolyn</strong> <strong>Culley</strong>, is a lovely lady who supports her husband’s career. Alongside running a household, she is associate director for strategy and success. In addition, she has over two decades of professional experience in online higher education operations.</p><p>So, let’s learn more about this talented individual in this article.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Have_Been_Together_For_Years></span>Have Been Together For Years<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aforementioned, the veteran coach, David Culley, is happily wedded to his partner, Carolyn Culley. However, when it comes to sharing the details of their affairs, he has been quite hesitant.</p><p>David hasn’t revealed when he first met his beautiful wife, Carolyn, in the media. He also hasn’t disclosed when they began dating or started their relationship. Likewise, his marriage date is also a mystery among his fans.</p><p>Still, going through his interviews, the pair likely have been married for several years. So both must have a strong bond, considering the fact that their marital life has been going smoothly.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Culley_Couple_Lost_One_Of_Their_Child></span>The Culley Couple Lost One Of Their Child<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The celebrity wife gave birth to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>two children</a> during her marriage with David. Her late son, <strong>David Demond Culley</strong><strong>, </strong>was better known as&nbsp;<strong>Monty Culley </strong>among his family and friends.</p><p>Sadly, David Culley’s son, Monty, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">passed away</a> in 2019 for undisclosed reasons. The latter was forty-five years old at that time and the loss impacted the family immensely. After her only son’s death, Carolyn must have been devasted and heartbroken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/David-Culley-Wife-Carolyn-Culley-is-a-mother-of-two.jpg><p>The couple is also the parents of a daughter named <strong>Jessie Culley.&nbsp;</strong>However, she hasn’t made much media appearance and keeps a private lifestyle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Culleys_Wife_Holds_Several_Degrees></span>David Culley’s Wife Holds Several Degrees<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Culley’s spouse, Carolyn, has proven to be intelligent and academically talented. She completed her <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">formal education at</a>&nbsp;McClintock High School.&nbsp;She then enrolled at&nbsp;Mesa Community College, where she obtained her Associate’s Degree in general studies in 1993.</p><p>The McClintock alumna attended&nbsp;Arizona State University for further study. She eventually received her BA in communication in 1995. Furthermore, she returned to university to get her Master of Science in digital audience strategy in 2018.</p><p>The arts graduate also holds a MAED in adult education and training from the&nbsp;University of Phoenix.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Learn About Daryl Williams’ Wife Amber</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Associate_Director_For_Strategy_And_Success></span>Is Associate Director For Strategy And Success<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the ASU graduate is a dedicated professional with over twenty years of experience in online higher education operations and academics. She has utilized her MAED and MS degrees to land herself a job as associate director for strategy and success at EdPlus&nbsp;at Arizona State University.</p><p>The associate director’s position entails making higher education strategies, identifying and implementing solutions for stakeholders, providing leadership for student success initiatives, etc. She previously worked as project manager and associate director of academic program manager in the company.</p><p>David Culley’s wife initially served in Phoenix Fan Fusion, Glynlyon Inc.,&nbsp;UoPX, Club Med Sales Inc.,&nbsp;etc. Her two decades-long experience has led her to be proficient in Online Higher Education leadership, Program Management, Project Management, Relationship Management, etc.</p><p>Thanks to her work experiences, Carolyn Culley’s net worth must be substantial.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Very_Supportive_Of_Her_Husbands_Career></span>Is Very Supportive Of Her Husband’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is said that there is a contribution of a woman behind every great man. And this can’t be further from the truth considering David and his wife, Carolyn’s relationship.</p><p>The coach has time and again credited his partner, Carolyn, for raising their kids and giving him the freedom to move their family to different places. He also shares how she never complained and was always prepared for their departure.</p><p>The duo’s mutual understanding and support have assisted them to enjoy a comfortable life together. The NFL coach also states he is a lucky guy to have married the right girl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/David-Culley-Wife-Carolyn-Culley-is-supportive.jpg><p>However, the pair isn’t much active in social media and rarely makes any media appearance. They must have done it to avoid unnecessary media scrutiny.</p><p>David has been let go by Houston Texans after only a season. Still, he has a bright future ahead in the NFL. We wish both him and his wife, Carolyn, immense success in the upcoming days.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebritymirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLDAr6CdZZOqua2x2Gauop6VYrCivs6lsKdlk6q5rbHYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./enes-kanter-girlfriend-wife-brother-salary-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Enes Kanter Have A Girlfriend?
