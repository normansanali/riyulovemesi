At the time, Apple TV+’s head of programming Matt Cherniss said: “We have loved the engaging, touching and hilarious world of Shrinking since the beginning, and it has been wonderful to watch as audiences around the world continue to connect with these big-hearted characters.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="We’re TV experts and these are the 14 best Apple TV+ shows to watch" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/661e9d41ca40-tv-roundup.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="We’re TV experts and these are the 14 best Apple TV+ shows to watch" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>We’re TV experts and these are the 14 best Apple TV+ shows to watch</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Harrison Ford's life and career: From Star Wars fame to Calista Flockhart marriage and near-miss helicopter accident" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/97143af38092-harrison-ford-calista-flockhart.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Harrison Ford's life and career: From Star Wars fame to Calista Flockhart marriage and near-miss helicopter accident" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Harrison Ford's life and career: From Star Wars fame to Calista Flockhart marriage and near-miss helicopter accident</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=elJJGOeZydJ data-wc=17>“We can’t wait for viewers to experience what the cast and creative team have for season 2.”&nbsp;</p><p id=e-Lf-TI1sSn5 data-wc=43>There is no word just yet about the airdate for season two, but there have been some recent updates from the show, including the exciting news that Ted Lasso star Brett Goldstein would be joining in a “small role” in the upcoming season.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8694b052d33b-megaharrisonford17.jpg><p id=eDtc-ecZdseo data-wc=85>The show’s co-creator, Bill Lawrence, has hinted that they will be making at least three seasons of the show, saying: “Part of the fun for me in doing shows with, like, Jason Segel and Harrison Ford, is that you can tell actors that you’ve always wanted to work with, ‘If you give me three seasons, that’s fine if you want to split.’ So all I can tell you is that all the gang that we roped in for this one was down for doing that.</p><p id=eb7QYT7tDo data-wc=11><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Calista Flockhart reveals why Harrison Ford acts differently around her</a></p><p id=eflHIftTgSjf data-wc=14>“The second year is about forgiveness, and the third year is about moving forward.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28c131ca2a45-shrinking.jpg><p id=e6tDh8I2iEsB data-wc=41>Jason Segel added to RadioTimes.com: “One of the things Bill [Lawrence, co-creator] said to me when I signed on was ‘We'll do this for as long as we're having fun’, which sounds like a great way to go into a project.”&nbsp;</p><p id=ePNVLZTJELtx data-wc=91>Harrison has also spoken very fondly about his time on the show. Discussing it at a Q&A, he explained: “This mixture of comedy and pathos and really emotional stuff, it gives you a sense of responsibility for the things you’re communicating and how you’re communicating. I think that that shows up on screen, and it shows up in the work these people do every day and how they do it. I had never done anything like this before and it was like suddenly recognizing what I’ve always wanted [acting] to be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a52248f647c8-shrinkingphoto010802.jpg><p id=eHtEKtr9DEvY data-wc=76>“People… come up to me and say something about the show. And then I get to say something… and then they turn around and walk away. They do not want a picture. They do not want an autograph. They do not want to do anything. They just want to communicate that this means something to them. And it’s an extraordinary experience in my life. That is a real thing. And it means the world to me.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
