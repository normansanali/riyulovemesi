After all, the Horned Frogs had been struggling for the last few seasons, which led to the departure of legendary coach Gary Patterson.</span></p><p class=p1><span>A number of players transferred out of the program following Patterson's departure, which left incoming head coach Sonny Dykes with some big holes to fill on his roster.</span></p><p class=p1><span><img alt="Alan Ali - Football - TCU Athletics" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net/sidearm.nextgen.sites/gofrogs.com/images/2022/10/27/KUvsTCU-199_tHpKu.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p class=p1><span>But Dykes worked the transfer portal expertly as he brought in 13 new players, including <a href=#>Alan Ali</a>, a vastly experienced interior offensive lineman who had started 39 games at SMU under Dykes. The sixth-year senior decided to make the switch, and it turned out very well for both him and TCU as they are now one win away from a national title.</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=#>Alan Ali</a> is a versatile offensive lineman who played in several different spots at SMU, but he eventually settled in at center and was named Second Team All AAC center last season. He quickly cemented himself as TCU’s starting center, and the interior of the offensive line instantly became of the strengths of the team.</span></p><p class=p1><span>With <a href=#>Alan Ali</a> leading the way in blocking for running back Kendre Miller, TCU became one of the top rushing offenses this season as they averaged 204.5 yards per game with 36 rushing touchdowns.</span></p><p class=p1><span><img alt="Minnesota Vikings player profile No. 72: OL Alan Ali" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vikingswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2023/04/USATSI_19799510.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p class=p1><span>And now, <a href=#>Alan Ali</a> and the Horned Frogs will face their biggest test against a Georgia front that was the best in the nation in stopping the run, giving up just 77 yards per game and only five rushing touchdowns. But that should not deter the Horned Frogs, who have overcome so many obstacles in this remarkable season.</span></p><p class=p1><span><a href=#>Alan Ali</a> is a major reason they have done so. Thanks to his transfer, TCU gained his invaluable experience and leadership that has helped them get to the brink of a national championship.</span></p><p class=p1><span>And to show your support for <a href=#>Alan Ali</a> and the rest of the TCU team, you can check out his complete collection over at Fan Arch.
