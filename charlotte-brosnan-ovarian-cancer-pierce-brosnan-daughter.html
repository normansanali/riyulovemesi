Pierce Brosnan's daughter Charlotte died of the same disease that took the life of his beloved first wife Cassandra Harris 22 years ago. Find out how Charlotte faced her demons before she died. Pierce Brosnan is devastated by the loss of his daughter Charlotte Brosnan, who died of ovarian cancer in London on July 28 at age 41. The Irish actor flew back from filming the spy flick November Man&nbsp;in Eastern Europe to be by his daughter's side, the UK's Daily Mail reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pierce-brosnan-and-his-daughter-charlotte-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-1130377></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“On June 28 my darling daughter Charlotte Emily passed on to eternal life, having succumbed to ovarian cancer,” Pierce, 60, told&nbsp;PEOPLE. “She was surrounded by her husband Alex, children Isabella and Lucas and brothers Christopher and Sean.”</p><h3>Charlotte Beat Depression, Addiction Before Her Untimely Death</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>At least Pierce can take comfort in the fact that Charlotte seemed at peace with herself before she passed. Charlotte beat a long battle with depression and drug addiction after she checked herself into rehab in London in 2003 when she was&nbsp;in her early thirties.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>She had previously checked into the same £4,000-a-week&nbsp;Priory Clinic for cocaine addiction and another time for depression over a temporary split from her husband Alex. Charlotte bravely rebuilt her life since checking out of rehab in 2003. She&nbsp;leaves behind a loving family: husband&nbsp;<strong>Alex Smith</strong>, their daughter <strong>Isabella</strong>, 14, and son <strong>Lucas</strong>, 8. She also leaves behind brothers <strong>Christopher</strong>, <strong>Sean</strong>, <strong>Dylan</strong> and <strong>Paris</strong>.</p><h3>Charlotte’s Mother Died Of The Same Disease At Age 43</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Charlotte’s mother and Pierce’s beloved wife, <strong>Cassandra Harris</strong>, also died of ovarian cancer in 1991 when she was 43. &nbsp;Pierce was madly in love with Cassandra, and he mourned her death “very publicly,” he said in an interview with the Daily Mail.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Such things draw a mark across your heart and it’s always a part of your life,” he added. “To watch someone you love have their life eaten away — bit by bit, by this insidious and horrid&nbsp; disease — becomes an indelible part of your psyche.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Pierce married Cassandra&nbsp;in 1980 and adopted Charlotte in 1986 when her biological father <strong>Dermot Harris</strong> died.&nbsp;Pierce later married&nbsp;American journalist and author&nbsp;<strong>Keely Shaye Smith</strong>&nbsp;in 2001, but he said “the memory of Cassie and her fight against cancer is never forgotten.” Pierce had two children with Keely but has&nbsp;always remained close with Charlotte, and with Sean and Christopher, who he fathered during his marriage to Cassandra.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>It’s so sad that he lost his wife and daughter to the same disease, but Pierce said,&nbsp;“Charlotte fought her cancer with grace and humanity, courage and dignity. Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our beautiful dear girl. We pray for her and that the cure for this wretched disease will be close at hand soon.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Read more about Charlotte’s battles here</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Daily Mail</a> ➚<p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>— Tierney McAfee</strong></p><h3>More Sad Deaths Of Celebrity Daughters:</h3><li>Houston Rockets Coach Kevin McHale’s Daughter Dies At 23</li><li>Barbara Bush Opens Up About Daughter, 3, Who Died Of Leukemia</li><li>Essie Mae Washington-Williams, Strom Thurmond’s Daughter, Dies</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH14e49rZpygkae5sMDTnmSbqp%2Bou6K6jKitmqqZlrtur8Cnmp6qXaW2pr7CnmSbqp%2Bou6K6jJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-godwin-contract-salary-and-net-worth-explored.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Godwin contract, salary and net worth explored</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cardi-b-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cardi B Net Worth (Updated 2022), Age, Husband, Boyfriend, Children, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
