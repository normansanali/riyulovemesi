Not only is he willing to choose time with his</span><a href=#><span> two daughters, Dusty Rose and Gio Grace</span></a><span>, over his Hollywood career, but he’ll do just about anything to see his girls smile, including wearing matching dresses with them. He became a dad for the third time in January 2023 with his wife,</span><a href=#> <b>Behati Prinsloo</b></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The Maroon 5 frontman</span><a href=#><span> shared the cutest pic</span></a><span> of their family donning similar ensembles in April 2021. In the snapshot, Adam, his wife and their tiny tots held hands while sporting pink tie-dye maxi dresses. “Girls just wanna have fun,” he adorably captioned the Instagram post.</span></p><p><a href=#><span>Seeing photos of the couple’s daughters</span></a><span> on social media is</span><a href=#><span> very rare</span></a><span> considering Adam and Behati are extremely private when it comes to their kids. </span><i><span>The Voice</span></i><span> alum and the brunette beauty have kept a tight lip on their relationship in general since marrying in 2014.</span></p><p><span>They became even more low-key after welcoming their daughters, however. The duo’s eldest, Dusty Rose, arrived in 2016, followed by Gio Grace in 2018. Fortunately, every now and then, Adam and Behati will give a glimpse inside their family life.</span></p><p><span>In addition to their cute matching moment, Adam</span><a href=#><span> shared a pic</span></a><span> of one of his girls holding a butterfly in February 2021. “I believe the future has potential,” he captioned the post. One day earlier, Behati</span><a href=#><span> uploaded a filtered selfie</span></a><span> with Gio in honor of her birthday, writing, “My bestie turned 3.”</span></p><p><span>Though the lovebirds keep their family out of the public eye as much as possible,</span><a href=#><span> Adam isn’t shy when it comes to gushing over his little ones</span></a><span> at red carpet events and in interviews. While chatting with</span><a href=#> <b>Ryan Seacrest</b></a><a href=#><span> during an episode of his radio show</span></a><span> in 2016, the “She Will Be Loved” crooner opened up about the difficult but “beautiful experience” of becoming a parent.</span></p><p><span>“What do I know? I don’t know anything, but it’s kind of part of the beauty of it, honestly,” he gushed. “There are a lot of instincts, a lot of things that kind of kick in and switch on.”</span></p><p><span>Even before he became a dad, Adam marveled over how excited he was to experience fatherhood. “You’re born to be a parent, that’s what we’re here for, really,” he</span><a href=#><span> told </span><i><span>Entertainment Tonight</span></i></a><span> prior to Dusty Rose’s birth. “All the other s—t is great, but it’s not what we’re here for.”</span></p><p><span>In September 2022, the couple confirmed their family was expanding once more. Behati shared photos of her growing baby bump on Instagram while wearing a cropped top. The pregnancy announcement came after she stepped out in Santa Barbara with her hubby in a figure-hugging dress, sparking pregnancy speculation.</span></p><p><span>That same month, Adam</span><a href=#><span> responded to cheating allegations</span></a><span> made by multiple women on social media, including model </span><b>Summer Stroh</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life,” the musician wrote in a statement posted on Instagram. “In certain instances, it became inappropriate. I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.”</span></p><p><span>Adam continued, “My wife and my family is all I care about in this world. To be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make. I will never make it again. I take full responsibility. We will get through it, and we will get through it together.”</span></p><p><span>Behati gave birth to her third child with Adam on January 30, 2023, according to </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><b>To learn more about Adam and Behati’s kids, scroll below.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46am5qlXaGyt7XNnmSkoZSoeq6xxK1koaGjYrCptcudqZ6mXay2tbSMm5yhmaSeerG%2ByKeqpaefZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andres-penate-net-worth-270588.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrs Penate Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./624145-2023-razzie-awards-nominate-pete-davidson-tom-hanks-mgk-and-more-in-worst-categories.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2023 Razzie Awards Nominate Pete Davidson, Tom Hanks, MGK, And More In &amp;quot;Worst&amp;quot; Categories</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
