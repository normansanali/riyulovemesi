Though she came in as the friend of<a href=#> self-proclaimed villain Christine Quinn</a>, she immediately proved to The Oppenheim Group that she's a serious realtor who can deliver. And like Christine, the mom-of-two also has a successful husband — Jeff Lazkani — who hypes her up throughout her journey into the brokerage. He was also a former client of <a href=#>The O Group's boss, Jason Oppenheim</a>. Here's everything you should know about Chelsea's husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset' Star Emma Hernan Claims Engaged Ben Affleck Messaged Her On Dating App</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-jeff-lazkani>Who Is Jeff Lazkani?</h2><p>Jeff isn't in real estate. He works as a Managing Partner at Icon Media Direct. His mother, Nancy Lazkani started the company in 2000. Jeff has been working in the company for 15 years. According to his company website, he is currently the "lead strategic point person for many of Icon's largest clients." He's also "often asked to author articles or speak to groups about the future of direct response television and media." That would come in handy in case he and Chelsea get caught in some explosive media spat. <a href=#>Chrishell Stause notably threatened to pursue legal actions against Christine</a> following some comments she made to the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But according to Chelsea, Jeff doesn't really concern himself about the drama from the show. "As far as the drama is concerned, I don't think he really cares," she said of her busy husband. "Sometimes I try [to catch him up], but he's in between like 10 meetings and he's like, 'Who's Vanessa?' And I'm like, 'She's someone.'" But through it all, Jeff has encouraged the real estate agent to pursue her reality TV career. "I think having the support of my husband and my family really prepared me to take on this big role and this opportunity," Chelsea added.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Do Men Work For The Oppenheim Group?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeff-lazkani-almost-bought-kanye-west-39-s-house>Jeff Lazkani Almost Bought Kanye West's House</h2><p>When Chelsea first met Jason, she told him about that time he sold her husband a house. The broker had a hard time remembering the newcomer when she initially introduced herself but vividly recalled Jeff's mom dissing <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>'s house. "This is funny, because not only did I show [Jeff] Kanye's house, where we get into escrow [the buyer's offer has been accepted] on Kanye's house," Jason shared. "We didn't say who it was. Jeff invited his mom, and his mom — not knowing whose house it was — says, 'It looks like a lonely narcissist lives here.' And Jeff canceled the escrow."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jason added, "There [was] a painting of Kanye as Jesus on the ceiling, like, pointing. The shower was like a goldfish tank." Not many fans reacted to the anecdote, but one wrote on Twitter: "I can't tell if Selling Sunset is fake because how did Chelsea say they showed her Kanye Wests old house to buy and and her husband makes 100k." They have a point. But according to reports, Jeff's company is actually huge success that within its first six months, it already earned a whopping $15 million in billings. We're guessing he's reported net worth isn't really accurate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Christine Quinn Really Pay $1,000 Per Day For Her Makeup On 'Selling Sunset'?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-chelsea-amp-jeff-lazkani-meet>How Did Chelsea & Jeff Lazkani Meet?</h2><p>Chelsea is proud to admit that she first met her husband on Tinder soon after arriving in L.A. She said he was his first match on the app. "I stayed because I fell in love... It was the best decision I've ever made," the realtor wrote of their story on Instagram. The two have been married since 2017. Together, they're raising a couple of kids, Melia and Maddox. Chelsea also revealed that joining Selling Sunset was her way of setting a good example for their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What gave me this work ethic was seeing my parents bust their a--," she said. "What I want to instill in my kids is they have this great life that they should be so grateful for and fortunate for but you see me and your father work in every day to maintain it." She added that she wants her kids to learn about success beyond the classroom walls. "I hope that they get a little bit of a hustle," she continued. "But you don't have to follow the traditional route to be successful. I'm on reality TV and I sell real estate, nothing of which I learned in school. I just want them to be passionate about something and willing to work hard."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of hard work, Chelsea also confessed that she had to "prove" herself in season 5 of Selling Sunset. "This season I came on and it was really about me proving myself and showing a little bit about my strength and my personality and how I'm here to work really hard." Still, she hopes to show more of her "vulnerability" in season 6.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Did Netflix's 'Selling Sunset' Start?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8eeo6ydkWK5osbKmqWiq12dwrSuwKebZqKVm7NuuMCzopqmmWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./archie-renaux-daughter-iris-shadow-actor-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Archie Renaux | Daughter Iris- Shadow, Actor Girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-tiktok-canceling-john-lennon-the-beatles-yoko-ono.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is TikTok Canceling John Lennon?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
