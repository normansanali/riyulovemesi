Introducing the men behind the brand, <strong>Reed Hastings</strong> and <strong>Marc Randolph</strong>…</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who owns Netflix?</h2><p id=eyJ1MOm1Ql data-wc=18>As Netflix is a public company listed on the stock market, it is technically owned by multiple people.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who founded Netflix?</h2><p id=ecdfIcyd31j data-wc=39>Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph are the co-founders of Netflix, Inc. Created in 1997, the duo began their business as a video-rental company. Calling all Millennials! Remember the days of receiving DVDs in the post? Talk about a throwback.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/8db33e65e834-netflix-logo-d.jpg><p id=e2yTB4vjKs data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Netflix's The Perfect Find viewers make same complaint about Gabrielle Union drama</a></p><p id=eZ1kNwe3dB data-wc=15><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Glamorous' Damian Terriquez talks Netflix show's future, Pride, and hanging out with Kim Cattrall</a></p><p id=efjg7Z93Wcv data-wc=22>It wasn't until 2007 that Netflix began offering subscribers the option to stream some of its movies, and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who is Reed Hastings?</h2><p id=exnJ4ZN1Cb2 data-wc=38>Following the streaming platform's continued success, Reed Hastings is now the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Netflix. He decided to step down as co-CEO in January, handing the reins over to Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/41989b9c5b85-reed-hastings-navy-suit.jpg><p id=eq6LqgWAuMs data-wc=41>As of 2023, Reed has an estimated net worth of $4.1 billion. According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes</a>, he currently owns 2% of the company. Since switching over to an executive chairman position, the 62-year-old has joined a number of boards and non-profit organizations.</p><p id=eTDKkz4mPbL data-wc=37>Despite his success with Netflix, Reed – a former computer scientist and mathematician – never set out to revolutionize the entertainment industry. As it turns out, the idea for the company was born out of sheer panic.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/0fe049f56754-reed-hastings-netflix-dvds.jpg><p id=eB2BpG2InCU data-wc=96>"I had a big late fee for Apollo 13," he famously recalled. "It was six weeks late and I owed the video store $40. I had misplaced the cassette. It was all my fault. I didn't want to tell my wife about it. And I said to myself, 'I'm going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late fee?' Later, on my way to the gym, I realized they had a much better business model. You could pay $30 or $40 a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted."&nbsp;</p><p id=eDIJQ4ipmqm data-wc=21>Away from his business dealings, Reed resides in Santa Cruz, California with his wife, Patricia Ann Quillin, and their two children.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who is Marc Randolph?&nbsp;</h2><p id=ewG-mdMZeIK data-wc=44>Marc Randolph is an American tech entrepreneur, advisor and speaker. Alongside Reed Hastings, he is a co-founder of Netflix. After launching the brand as a video-rental company in 1997, Marc eventually stepped down as CEO in 1999, and officially departed the company in 2003.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/00535effc119-marc-randolph-on-mountain.jpg><p id=eRtRpw2_LQy data-wc=31>In a 2019 interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes</a>, the 65-year-old referred to himself as "an invisible face" when it comes to Netflix, but he remains content with his decision to leave the company.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHsa_SxwK9C data-wc=55>According to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Marc has a current net worth of $100 million.
