Her roles in everything from major films to cameos in hit TV shows have made her not only widely known and appreciated, but relatively wealthy.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Waddingham is quite the singer as well, and even had a role in the Award-winning 2012 adaptation of the musical Les Misérables. She played a Factory Woman, likely lending her vocals to the soundtrack. It is unclear what Waddingham would have made in this role, but seeing as the film grossed nearly $150 million, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Numbers</a>, at the very least she hopefully got a generous paycheck.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Waddingham has also had rolled on several hit TV shows, including Game of Thrones and Sex Education. She played Septa Unella on eight episodes of Game of Thrones, Jax-Ur on 13 episodes of Krypton, Sofia Marchetti on 14 episodes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sex Education</a>, and Lady Bellaston on 3 episodes of the mini-series Tom Jones. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Backstage</a>, actors and actresses in roles like hers commonly make up to $3,000 a day for TV show appearances. Not too shabby.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Though she has appeared in a whole host of films, one of her most recent was the role of the Mother Witch in Hocus Pocus 2. Though her salary for the long-awaited sequel is unclear, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly reports</a> was one of the most streamed Disney Plus films of all time, so they likely cut her a nice check.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Of course, her most iconic role will always be in Ted Lasso. For three seasons she graced our screen as Rebecca Welton. Not only did the role earn her an Emmy, but by season three, Waddingham was also earning somewhere between $125,000 and $150,000 per episode, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Slash Film</a>.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>The actress also has several, probably high-paying, upcoming projects including her very own Apple TV Plus Holiday special and a role in the 2024 Garfield movie. Her musical special Home for Christmas will premiere on November 22.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>With so much behind her and so much on the horizon, Hannah Waddingham has certainly proven herself when it comes to being an actress and singer. While Ted Lasso fans may miss Rebecca, everyone is anxiously waiting to see what Waddingham does next. It’s only going up from here, as is her net worth of, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, $4 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZiWu6%2Btx2aumpyUnruotMCmqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-childresss-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Richard Childress Dating Richard Childress's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./warframe-how-to-get-dual-ichor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Warframe - How To Get The Dual Ichor, And Why People Want It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
