The location is Beachwood Estates in High River, Alberta. This is a small neighborhood built between 1990 and 2002, though in 2013, the province was hit by a devastating flood that forced many Albertans to abandon their homes. Recognizing the location was no longer safe, the province purchased the 94 properties in the flood plain and relocated the residents.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Since then, the neighborhood has been abandoned. YouTuber Seth Lawless took a trip there in 2017 and explored it in a video aptly titled, “The Creepiest Neighborhood in the World.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Lawless compared the atmosphere to The Walking Dead, so it’s no surprise that The Last of Us location scouts jumped at the chance to realize Bill’s compound here. Having said that, the previous residents don’t seem particularly happy that their former homes look like the backdrop to the apocalypse. Ryan White had to abandon his tattoo parlor in 2013 and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said it was painful</a> to look back at the neighborhood in this state:</p><p>“I just don’t think people take into consideration the actual PTSD it caused for the whole community.
