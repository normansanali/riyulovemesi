Kim opened up, in tears, saying, “It was like a bad dream. It’s definitely nothing I ever thought I’d be dealing with in my life.”</p><p>Kroy described the incident in detail saying, “I had the leaf blower on my back. Sinn doesn’t like the blower so he was already on high alert.” When describing just how devastating the injury appeared at first, Kroy explained, “[Kash] pulls his hands down and there’s multiple lacerations. I can’t see his eye. All I see is dark. … I know that it’s a very dire emergency.”</p><p>Kash, who was in the hospital for four days, undergoing surgery and receiving a whopping eight stitches in order to preserve his eye, emerged from the ordeal triumphantly. When Kim referred to Kash’s jaw as “broken,” the little one slyly responded, “No it’s not.” In a sweet moment, Kim agreed with her son’s medical evaluation and concluded, “You’re right. It’s perfect.”</p><p><a href=#>There are no words to describe the episode tomorrow night of Don't Be Tardy ✨NEW TIME 9pm EST✨ Kroy and I after a few tough days and many conversations decided to share our story about Kash and the dog bite. Im sick to my stomach and my eyes are full of tears as I try to even write this.. the sole purpose we did share this was to raise awareness that this can happen to ANYONE! I'll never forget Kash's plastic surgeon a few weeks after the bite/ and Kash's surgery, He looked me square in my eyes and said, "You guys know how blessed you are (it was less than a millimeter from his eye ball (his waterline was sliced in half) and you have the platform to raise awareness and I hope you do!" Well Dr Williams you best believe we willl!!! Kash has healed incredibly and we are so grateful for Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta, Dr Joseph Williams, Dr Jerry Berland from the Thomas Eye Group, Truly Original Entertainment, Bravo, all of our family and friends, film crew, Kash's school, @simonourianmd1 (he calmed me for weeks) every tweet, every comment and every PRAYER! We truly don't know what we would of done without you! I will NOT be doing IG or FB live tomorrow night, but I will be back on next week. Thank you guys so much for all your support. ❤️ P.S My Kashew is the strongest little boy I know!</a></p><p>A post shared by Kim Zolciak-Biermann (@kimzolciakbiermann) on Nov 9, 2017 at 6:44pm PST</p><p>Kim’s 20-year-old daughter <strong>Brielle</strong> later divulged that if the injury “was a centimeter above where he got bit, he would have lost his eye.” She then explained that he “had to get plastic surgery” in order to repair the damage from the accident.</p><p>Kim then opened up, explaining that her estranged mother, <strong>Karen Zolciak</strong>, had reached out about Kash’s attack. Kim dryly admitted, “She said ‘Kash is in our prayers.’ … She’s never even met Kash.” Kim appeared apathetic over her mother’s prayers and said, “I don’t give two f—ks about my mom texting me in this situation.”</p><p>The rest of the episode followed Kim and Kroy’s painful decision about the fate of their dog Sinn. Kroy, furious at the animal, kept repeating, “I hate him.” Kroy, who immediately wanted the dog put down, hesitated at the urging of Kim who revealed, “I want Kash to not have any kind of emotional scars from this … Kash wants to see [Sinn]. That’s the only reason he’s alive.”</p><p>After meeting with an animal behaviorist, the Biermanns learned the incident was the result of a quick “back-off” bite with no intent of malice on the part of the dog. The behaviorist shed some light on the dog bite saying, “A 140-pound dog is gonna cause a lot more damage if they wanted to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the months following their son’s hospital stay, the Biermann family has reportedly decided to let the dog who bit Kash remain in the family home.</p><p>Tell Us: What do you think of Kim and Kroy’s decision to keep their dog?</p><p>Don’t Be Tardy airs on Bravo Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuopqRir6Z505qpnbFdp7Kkrc9moqKlXa%2B8ra%2FImqJmnJWprqq40maqqKZdoK60tNJmm6ifXZe2tbGO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1667877-is-it-ok-to-not-try-to-panicly-hide-your-boner-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is it ok to not try to panicly hide your boner?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./devin-townsend-net-worth-139529.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Devin Townsend Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
