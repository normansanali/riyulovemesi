The New Jersey native is one of the top prospects in the country and has been making waves with his performances on the court. Wagner is a 6-foot-3, 180-pound shooting guard who has <a href=#>committed</a> to play at the University of Kentucky. However, many are wondering whether he will eventually make the jump to the NBA.</p><p>Wagner comes from a basketball family. His father, Dajuan Wagner, played in the NBA for four seasons and was a highly regarded <a href=#>prospect</a> himself coming out of high school. Wagner’s grandfather, Milt Wagner, played in the NBA for several seasons as well. It’s clear that basketball is in his blood, and he has been honing his craft from a young age.</p><p>Wagner is known for his scoring ability. He has a smooth shooting stroke and can score from all three levels. He can knock down shots from beyond the arc, create his own shot off the dribble, and finish strong at the rim. Wagner is also a solid defender and has the athleticism to guard multiple positions.</p><p>Wagner’s high school career has been impressive so far. He has been playing for Camden High School, where he has led the team to a state championship and an undefeated season. He has earned a reputation as one of the best players in the country, and his performances have caught the attention of college coaches and NBA <a href=#>scouts</a> alike.</p><p>Wagner committed to Kentucky in February 2021, choosing the Wildcats over other top programs such as Michigan, Syracuse, and Ohio State. Kentucky has a reputation for producing NBA talent, and Wagner will have the opportunity to develop his game under the tutelage of head coach John Calipari. It’s clear that Wagner has his sights set on playing at the <a href=#>highest level</a>, but the question remains whether he will enter the NBA draft after his freshman year.</p><p>The NBA requires players to be at least 19 years old and one year removed from high school before they can enter the draft. This means that Wagner will need to play at least one season at Kentucky before he can declare for the draft. If he has a strong freshman season and shows that he can compete at the college level, he may be a top pick in the draft.</p><p>However, there are some factors that may influence Wagner’s decision. Firstly, he may want to stay at Kentucky for more than one year to develop his game further and potentially win a national championship. Secondly, he may want to consider the G League pathway program, which allows players to earn money while developing their skills and preparing for the NBA. Finally, there is always the risk of injury, which could derail his NBA dreams if he decides to declare for the draft too early.</p><p>In conclusion, DJ Wagner is a highly regarded <a href=#>prospect</a> who has committed to play at the University of Kentucky. While it’s unclear whether he will ultimately make the jump to the NBA, he has all the skills and potential to become a star at the next level. Wagner will need to navigate the challenges of being a high-profile athlete and make smart decisions both on and off the court to achieve his goals. Whether he stays at Kentucky for multiple years or declares for the draft after his freshman season, it’s clear that the basketball world will be watching closely to see what he does next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6iqmacmmLEorPNnqlmn5%2Beu6h506hkraCVYrujrQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-will-hurd-black-race-family-details-religion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Will Hurd Black What Is His Race?
