Hurd landed the role of Lauren Baldwin in the Starz original series Power Book II: Ghost, a prequel to the well-known series Power. Tariq St. Patrick (Michael Rainey) was confronted with a new reality after the murder of his father and the incarceration of his mother in the sequel.&nbsp;Hurd’s Baldwin was Rainey’s Tariq’s love interest, and their chemistry had fans shipping them.</p><h2>Is Michael Rainey the boyfriend of Paige Hurd?</h2><p>Even though the stars have never intimated that they are dating, people have speculated that they are. During Hurd’s birthday, Rainey posted a collage of them and wished her a happy birthday. Others followed suit, wishing the actress a happy birthday, while some inquisitive fans inquired whether the actors were dating. When Rainey posted a picture of himself semi-hugging Hurd, followers questioned the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Paige-Hurd-2.jpg><p>They weren’t alone, even on Twitter. Fans got into a frenzy when their characters kissed on the show, yearning for them to be together. One user took to Twitter. “Has it been verified that Tariq and Lauren are indeed dating?”&nbsp;Another user reshared Hurd and Rainey’s picture collage with the caption, “Tariq and Lauren exhibiting off-screen chemistry.”&nbsp;However, Hurd confirmed that she was not seeing someone in response to a user who said he was sad when he discovered she had a boyfriend and kissed Tariq. She does, however, have an open mind when it comes to dating, confessing to WMagazine that she responds to some of the attractive males that slip into her DMs.</p><h2>Quincy Jones and Paige Hurd</h2><p>While Power fans are rooting for Hurd and Rainey, others are hopeful she would date her long-time friend Quincy Jones, the adoptive son of Sean Combs, nicknamed Diddy. Hurd posted a series of images and videos on Instagram on June 5 in honor of Jones’ 30th birthday, along with a meaningful statement. Wow. “We’ve been rocking since we were 15 years old, and we’ve been there for each other through it all.” the wonderful, amusing, ugly, and sometimes difficult times in our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Paige-Hurd-1.jpg><p>She also said how grateful she was to have him in her life and how much she loved him. Some admirers indicated their want to be more than pals in the comments area, with one adding, “Go ahead date get married smh.” Friends who have known each other for a long time form the finest pair.”&nbsp;Nobody knows whether Hurd has a boyfriend right now.
