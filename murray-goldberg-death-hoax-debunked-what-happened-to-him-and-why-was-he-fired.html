How did the ABC comedy deal with Jeff Garlin’s cantankerous alter ego going away?</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After Season 9, Murray Goldberg stopped appearing in “The Goldbergs” due to Jeff Garlin’s abrupt termination. Here’s the reason he abruptly departed the program.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=murray-goldberg-death-hoax-debunked-what-happened-to-him></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Murray Goldberg Death Hoax Debunked; What Happened To Him?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As “The Goldbergs” Season 9 continued in December 2021, Jeff Garlin agreed to depart the program as soon as possible. No issues with finances or artistic differences led to this decision.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After Jeff Garlin left, Murray Goldberg was killed off between seasons.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The characters on The Goldbergs will be mourning a loss when Season 10 starts, just like the performers on the set. Co-showrunner Alex Barnow revealed to EW in August 2022 that it was decided to murder Murray Goldberg between seasons.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The new season will begin several months after Murray’s off-screen passing, so everyone will have had time to mourn and begin their next chapter by the time it picks up, according to Barnow.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Barnow added that the upcoming season would focus more on looking forward than looking back.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-was-murray-goldberg-fired></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Why Was Murray Goldberg fired?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In a lengthy interview with Vanity Fair conducted just before Thanksgiving, Garlin refuted reports that he had been let go from the series, saying:<img data-perfmatters-preload decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebdoko.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-22-092605.jpeg title="Murray Goldberg Death Hoax Debunked; What Happened To Him And Why Was He Fired?" alt="Screenshot 2022 09 22 092605" height=246 width=727 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In a forthcoming Instagram post, Jeff Garlin revealed himself.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Murray’s death occurred off-screen, but “The Goldbergs” Season 10 has nevertheless been completed with the return of most of the core actors. On September 21, only a few hours before the first several episodes aired, Jeff Garlin made an unexpected statement on Instagram.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Bipolar is an m******. I’m doing my best, but sometimes it’s just too much to handle,” he continued. This is the first time I’ve talked about it openly.” It is uncertain how long ago Garlin was given a bipolar disorder diagnosis, but one can only hope that he has been and is still receiving the right care for it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Instead, it had to do with severe accusations against Garlin by “Goldbergs” staff members and several inquiries into his behavior conducted by the department of human resources for the show.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Murray Goldberg actor is reportedly physically and verbally violent to several persons on the set. When his firing was made public, many people rejoiced.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> Cedric Lee Parents: What Happened To Ex-Bataan Mayor And Where Is He Now Jail Or Prision?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWlp7%2BixYygpqWckpq%2FqHnDnpitoF2dvKLEjJ2cm62eoLKledahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9itaq5jJqlnWWnncZuw8CsZKGdXZu2s7HDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sultan-of-brunei-net-worth-276564.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sultan of Brunei Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-bezos-fiancee-lauren-sanchez-surprises-fans-photo-three-children-talks-momentous-moment.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Sanchez surprises fans with photo of all three children as she talks 'momentous' moment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
