Content creator and actress Grace Van Dien – best known as Stranger Things’ Chrissy Cunningham – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was the most recent to join the ranks only a few days ago</a>.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>One would that the addition of a new famous face would elicit a positive response from the OG members, but this isn’t the case here, as some at the organization feel these new recruits are leading the brand’s true purpose astray.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>FaZe Rain was particular in pointing the radar at Grace by calling her inclusion into the Clan as “political.” To be specific, he meant that being an actress was a major advantage. The comment paved the way for an exchange of bitter words between the two, which started with Van Dien’s initial response.</p><p>“I’m sorry sir, were you in the meeting with us? Were you there? No, I’ve never f*cking met you and that is not why FaZe signed me. That is definitely how I got the meeting, yes, I will give that credit. That is how I got the meeting. But, that is absolutely not why I’ve signed. The things that we spoke about in the meeting are why I have. So, get f*cking wrecked to everyone saying that, to Rain saying that. Like, you weren’t there, you have no idea.”</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>To which, Rain blurted out a caustic defensive response saying,</p><p>“Grace, I’m sorry. All I want to say is, you’re Gold in Valorant. Make Stranger Things your entire personality, even though you were on only one episode. You found out about Twitch through Tumblr. Not only have you not hit a trick shot, but you don’t even know what the f**k that is! When you were still playing with Barbies, I made my first million out of this industry. On top of it, you’re excruciatingly mid, who I would never let touch me on my drunkest night.”</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Grace – who took the jab at her career as crossing a line – brought up Rain’s drug overdose in her next rebuttal, implying that someone with a bad history of abusing drugs doesn’t get to judge others,</p><p>“He says I don’t even know what a trickshot is, you’re right, I don’t. And I know that’s kinda what you’re known for. But I know you, Rain, as the person who almost overdosed on a live stream, and I know that you are better now and I’m really proud of you for that.”</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>FaZe Rain is acutely aware of his addiction issues which negatively affected his physical health, and Grace’s barb on this aspect of his wild past earned her backlash and criticisms on Twitter, with some people calling it “despicable.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Grace Van Dien is now facing backlash for her response to FaZe Rain, where she brings up his OD from nearly 3 years ago</p><p>I agree this felt really out of place and unnecessary <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EfnmWPNC67</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href=#>May 29, 2023</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>grace van dien throwing rain’s overdose in his face with a smile on hers over the cringe ass org she joined is fucking despicable. what the fuck</p>— lex 🪐 (@777saturns) <a href=#>May 29, 2023</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>Grace Van Dien took Nadia’s throne for most hated woman in gaming</p>— Will 🏡 (@_suburbanwill) <a href=#>May 29, 2023</a><p dir=ltr lang=en>Grace Van Dien has responded to FaZe Rain</p><p>She agrees that she doesn’t know what a trickshot is, and brings up his history of almost ODing <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XA1hV8POle</a></p>— Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href=#>May 28, 2023</a><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=false>No one is happy with Grace’s comeback, and until she takes accountability for her actions, the furious indignation will keep on flowing thick and fast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TAtb7Ap56eql2ptaq6xqxkrKyRp3q2usOeqWaemaeybrLOq2SbqpmjtKq6xmasqWWRYrumrdFmnZqskaF6pb7UoGSorpWnsbC%2FxGagp2Wnlr9uu8VmrqiqlKh6uLXToWSroaaWuW6%2F06ucmqWVp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-longest-yard-remake-in-development.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Longest Yard Remake in the Works at Paramount Pictures</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-kardashian-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Kardashian Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
