In her neighborhood, Maureen Wener served as a mother, friend, and role model. That many people are honoring the 49-year-old woman who was kἰlled on Friday 2 June, afternoon while riding her bicycle close to Deerfield and Piccadilly road in a hit-and-run accἰdent.</p><p>I hope they track down the perpetrator. It’s difficult to accept that she’s gone. It truly is, according to Deerfield Public Library child services librarian Noreen Trotsky. Maureen was considerate. She had a really kind disposition. She was always friendly and curious to know how things were doing. She will be sorely missed.</p><p>According to police, the car left the scene, and Wener later pἀssed suddenly from her w0unds at a nearby hospital. Before the cops arrived, according to local resident Steven Hiller, one woman started performing CPR right away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Maureen-Wener.webp><p>What was going through Hiller’s mind was how awful it was that the woman went for a bike ride and ended up falling over.</p><p>Wener served on numerous local boards, which allowed her influence to be felt by many. She was well-known to the state representative for the 58th district Bob Morgan. Her description by him was “a true public servant.”</p><p><strong>Morgan Stated-</strong></p><p>“Deerfield Public Schools District 109 and here at Deerfield Public Library are the two places where everyone who lives here either knows Maureen or knows of her.”</p><p>According to her neighbors, she left her son and her husband, Paul, behind. In front of their house, a memorial remembering the woman who gave so much to those around her has been developing.</p><p><strong>You can also read about the Sherry Schmidt accἰdent. She lost her life in a car crash. You can read all information in the below article provided:</strong></p><p>We really need somebody like her. That is really sad. It is a huge l0ss. She was well-known to many individuals, according to Hiller. No one has been detained and police have not given a description of the car that struck Maureen.</p><p>If you wanted to check out more articles like this then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdga3xxgo6mmK6qlZq7bsPEp5yrZZKeuKZ5wJyaopyVo8Fw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-blair-net-worth-310976.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Molly Blair Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mafs-katina-goode-olajuwon-dickerson-split-read-statement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MAFS' Katina Goode, Olajuwon Dickerson Split: Read Statement</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
