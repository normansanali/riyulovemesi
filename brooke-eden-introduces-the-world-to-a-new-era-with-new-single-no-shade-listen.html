Featuring Eden’s signature vocal swagger and a new sound, the song’s lyrics throw “no shade” or judgment to people who aren’t seeing the same hue.</p><p>“My music before was a little edgier, a little darker, and a little more cynical, and now my music is happy. Three years ago I got off the road and I wanted to spend time figuring out what I wanted to say and what I wanted my sound to be and I had a write with Jesse Fraser — who is now my producer — and I was like, ‘hey listen. I want to do create a sound with you thats been living in my head but I haven’t been able to get out into a track yet. I described what I wanted to hear, and the first four chords that he pulled out were the beginning of my new sound,” Brooke tells Celeb Secrets Country over a Zoom call.</p><p>“[‘No Shade’] is kind of where we left off from ‘Act Like You Don’t. It wasn’t even really meant to go this way, but it just kind of worked out that ‘No Shade’ is almost a continuation of where I was then and where I am now. It’s about coming out of that tumultuous relationship — after you kind of lost who you were in this toxic place — and pulling yourself out of that dark place, figuring out who you are now and realizing your growth.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Secondary-Image-683x1024.jpg><p>Penned from the heart with the help of <strong>Steven Lee Olsen</strong> and <strong>Brandon Day</strong>, “No Shade” reintroduces Eden with a clever play on a break-up song. Though more than that, it’s the story of a woman rediscovering herself after spending years in a situation that stifled who she was and who she wanted to be. “Nobody going to steal my sunshine or turn my blue sky grey / All I know is at the end of the day wildflowers grow when there ain’t no shade,” Eden sings, and you can hear the two meanings at work in her powerhouse vocal. The track was also produced by <strong>Jesse Frasure</strong>, whose credits include artists like <strong><a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a>, <a href=#>Florida Georgia Line</a>, <a href=#>Kane Brown</a>, <a href=#>Marshmello</a></strong> and <a href=#><strong>Meghan Trainor</strong></a>.</p><p>“We wrote the song three days before we went into the studio to record these [new] songs. It just so happened that [‘No Shade’] was the beginning of the story. I didn’t even know that we were trying to write that. It’s about someone coming into their own and I really feel like that’s where I’ve been for the last three years. It’s called ‘No Shade’ because you’re pulling yourself out of this dark place, but if you listen to the song, it’s also about pulling yourself out of a shady situation.”</p><p>Just yesterday, Brooke released the accompanying music video for the song which you can watch below. Filmed and directed by <strong>Ford Fairchild</strong>, the visual portrays Eden’s full-circle journey highlighting her previous bartending and performance gigs that led to her start in Nashville.</p><p>“Filming the music video for ‘No Shade’ had me incredibly in my element.” says Eden in a statement. “I got to bring my Nashville creative team down to my hometown in sunny south Florida, right back to the bar that started it all. The tiki bar where the video takes place is actually the bar where I played shows that earned me the money to move to Nashville. It was a total full circle moment filming the first part of this three video story, in the city that gave me the confidence to chase this dream.”</p><p>“No Shade” is the first taste of Eden’s reintroduction, with two new songs coming in March and April. The trilogy of songs follow the singer’s <a href=#>2017 single “Act Like You Don’t”</a> and debut EP <a href=#><strong>Welcome to the Weekend</strong></a>, which was released back in 2016.&nbsp;<u></u></p><p>“[‘No Shade’] is the beginning of my personal story,” Eden shares with us. “For the two songs after that, you’ll see how my love life and my relationship now comes into the picture. You get to see the progression of me being in a tumultuous relationship and coming into myself as a whole person, meeting the love of my life and seeing how that progresses as well.”</p><p>CS Country sits down with Eden to talk about “No Shade,” her new sound, and her relationship with her girlfriend Hilary.
