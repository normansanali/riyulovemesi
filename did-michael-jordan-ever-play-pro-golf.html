While he never played professional golf, he has been deeply involved in the sport and has even built his own private golf course. Here is a closer look at Jordan's golfing journey and his impact on the world of golf.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Early Golfing Influences</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jordan's love for golf began during his college days at the University of North Carolina. He was introduced to the sport by his friend Davis Love III, who played on the university's golf team. Jordan and Love would often go to the Finley Golf Club in Chapel Hill to hit balls, even though basketball was their primary focus at the time.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>A Passion for the Game</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Over the years, Jordan's passion for golf grew, and he became a regular player. Golf provided him with an escape from the pressure and chaos of his basketball career. He described golf as a place where he could get away from all the noise and find peace.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Building His Own Golf Course</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2015, Jordan took his love for golf to the next level by building his own private golf course, known as the Grove XXIII, located in Hobe Sound, Florida. The course is shrouded in secrecy and is often referred to as "Slaughterhouse XXIII." Only a select few have had the privilege of playing on this exclusive course.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Grove XXIII Members' Tournament</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the highlights at Grove XXIII is the annual members' tournament, where Jordan partners with different players to compete. In 2021, Jordan teamed up with PGA Tour golfer Keegan Bradley and emerged victorious in the tournament. As a trophy, they were awarded a special bottle of Jordan's own tequila brand, Cincoro.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jordan's Tequila Brand</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Michael Jordan is not only a golfer but also a tequila connoisseur. He launched his own tequila brand called Cincoro, which has gained popularity among golfers and enthusiasts alike. The trophy for winning the members' tournament at Grove XXIII was a prestigious bottle of Jordan's Cincoro Extra Añejo tequila, a 1.75-liter bottle in a special case with glasses.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Affinity for Philanthropy</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Since retiring from basketball, Jordan has become increasingly philanthropic with his billions. He has used his influence and resources to make a positive impact on various charitable causes. While golf is a personal passion for him, he has also leveraged it to raise funds for charitable organizations through events and initiatives.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Lasting Legacy</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Although Michael Jordan never pursued a professional golf career, his impact on the sport cannot be denied. His love for golf and his involvement in the golfing community have inspired many athletes and fans around the world. Jordan's Grove XXIII golf course and his Cincoro tequila brand have become symbols of his dedication to the sport and his desire to create unique experiences for fellow golf enthusiasts.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Michael Jordan did not play professional golf, his passion for the game, his own private golf course, and his tequila brand have made him a prominent figure in the golfing world.
