Celeb Secrets Country was in attendance mingling with honorees, artists and other VIPs all evening — including <strong><a href=#>Blanco Brown</a>, <a href=#>Naomi Cooke Johnson</a>, <a href=#>Spencer Crandall</a>, <a href=#>Ana Cristina Cash</a>, <a href=#>Jenny Tolman</a></strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Craig Campbell</strong></a> — where we were able to get an inside look at what the night really means for some of the genre’s most talented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Megan-Moroney-scaled.jpg><p>“It’s an honor to be here. My life since last year — my fans have completely changed my life with [‘Tennessee Orange’] — so everything looks a lot different,” <a href=#><strong>Megan Moroney</strong></a> tells CS Country host <strong>Juliet Schroder</strong> on the red carpet.</p><p>Although Sunday’s event was not her first SESAC Awards, this was her first time being honored at the big show, which she says is all because of her fans.</p><p>“We weren’t even going to release [‘Tennessee Orange],'” she reveals. “That’s the craziest thing… I released it as an independent artist, so when you look at that, I think it’s the true testament to my fans because everything I’ve done in the past is because of them. It’s crazy.”</p><p>The 26-year-old 2x CMA Award nominee kicked off the reception with her No. 1 single “Tennessee Orange,” which was honored during the awards ceremony. <a href=#><strong>Jon Nite </strong></a>was also named SESAC’s “Songwriter of the Year” at the annual show, as he was recognized for penning hits like <strong><a href=#>Tyler Hubbard</a>‘</strong>s “Dancin’ In The Country,” <a href=#><strong>Brett Young</strong></a>‘s “You Didn’t,” and <a href=#><strong>Gabby Barrett</strong></a>‘s “Pick Me Up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jon-Nite-SESAC-Songwriter-of-the-Year-scaled.jpg><p>To no surprise, <a href=#><strong>Kane</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Katelyn Brown</strong></a>‘s smash crossover hit “Thank God” was awarded SESAC’s “Song of the Year,” where Kane was on hand to accept the new hardware with songwriters <strong>Josh Hoge</strong> and <strong>Christian Stalnecker</strong>. Sony Music Publishing also took home “Publisher of the Year” after winning seven awards throughout the night. Before guests were treated to an array of sweets to say their goodbyes, <a href=#><strong>Dillon Carmichael</strong></a> performed his song “Son Of A,” which received a performance award during the ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Shannan-Hatch-Blanco-Brown-Lydia-Schultz-Cahill-scaled.jpg><p>Keep scrolling to watch our interviews with artists and special guests on the red carpet, plus a full list of honorees from the big show.
