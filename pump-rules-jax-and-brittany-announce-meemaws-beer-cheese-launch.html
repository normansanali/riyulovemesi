More specifically, the pair are gearing up for the launch of Meemaw’s Beer Cheese.</p><p>Brittany, who hails from Kentucky, first mentioned the business idea during the Sunday, December 16, episode of Vanderpump Rules when talking about her family connection to one of her favorite foods. “Beer cheese is a beer cheese spread. It has cheese, it has other spices, it has beer in it,” she explained. “I’ve grown up on this stuff — my Meemaw has made it my entire life, and it’s just delicious.”</p><p>Added the SUR server, “I can’t wait to bring it to L.A.”</p><p>Though Brittany, 29, didn’t add any specific information regarding the launch of the product, the reality TV star previously told <a href=#>Bravo</a> that she and her husband-to-be are actually expanding upon a business idea started by her beloved grandmother back in Kentucky.</p><p>“Meemaw, she has her beer cheese that’s she’s been selling for a long time, so Jax and I are just trying to take it to the next level,” Brittany noted. “We are working with a couple different companies in L.A. to try to get it going and it’s gonna be on this season … Meemaw’s beer cheese. It’s gonna be up and running soon!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-Brittany-Cartwright-Beer-Cheese-01.jpg><p>And while reality TV stars starting a business is nothing new, Brittany made it clear that it’s all all about the family connection for her. “I love beer cheese and just cause my meemaw makes it and it’s her recipe, it just makes it special for me,” she added.</p><p>Business ventures aside, the plans for Jax and Brittany’s upcoming nuptials seem to be moving along quite nicely. Though the couple had initially intended to tie the knot in Malibu, sources tell Us Weekly they now plan to <a href=#>marry in Brittany’s native Kentucky</a> in the summer of 2019 so they can be closer to her family. They’ve since revealed they will say their “I dos” at the Kentucky Castle.</p><p>The guest list, however, might be a bit more complicated. While Vanderpump costars <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> are <a href=#>in Brittany’s bridal party</a>, and a host of other costars are expected to attend the wedding, it’s unclear if cast member <strong>James Kennedy</strong> will score an invite.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kennedy, who frequently DJs at SUR, <a href=#>ruffled feathers in the season 7 premiere</a> of the Bravo hit when he rapped about Jax’s past indiscretion with <strong>Faith Stowers</strong> in front of Brittany. “That’s pretty much what he does. That’s his MO. He needs to bring up things that happened years ago because there’s nothing for him to talk about,” Jax told Us exclusively, later adding, “We don’t really talk to him much anymore.”</p><p>And Brittany isn’t buying James’ excuse that the rap lyric was a swipe at Jax, explaining to Us, “He tries to say that that was about Jax, but Jax wasn’t there. I was the one that was there, I was the one that was embarrassed in front of the entire crowd, not Jax. So him trying to be like, ‘That was about Jax,’ that doesn’t make sense. That’s no ground to stand on because I was the one who got hurt that day.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqmtnaV6s8HLnqpmopGteqK6w2aZq6Gkqa6vxYyapaenpaOwpnnMnpymmaeoeqOxxKtknKCVmsCmecuarKebmGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./runaway-michigan-girl-found-in-new-bern-north-carolina-man-charged-with-kidnapping-and-rape-jerome-farrow-jr-first-degree-kidnapping-statutory-rape-craven-county-jail-department-of-social-services.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Runaway Michigan girl found in North Carolina; man charged with kidnapping and rape</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nika-madrid-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nika Madrid Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
