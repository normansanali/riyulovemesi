Singer Gracie Abrams, who’s been opening for Taylor on her Eras tour, recently gave insight into what it’s like hanging at Taylor’s house, showing it’s not all fun and games. She specifically recalled a time a fire started because of a candle.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">recent interview with Billboard,</a> Gracie, 24, disclosed that she and Taylor, 34, had completed a new song titled “Us” (which releases later this month) just before a fire incident occurred.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:16</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-isn-t-the-only-artist-who-has-turned-down-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift Isn't The Only Artist Who Has Turned Down The Super Bowl Halftime Show">Taylor Swift Isn't The Only Artist Who Has Turned Down The Super Bowl Halftime Show</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift isn't the only musician who has turned down the Super Bowl Halftime Show, with other big-name artists also saying no to the gig.</p><h2 id=taylor-stopped-the-fire-with-her-quick-thinking>Taylor Stopped The Fire With Her Quick Thinking</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singers had been unwinding with drinks and dinner in the early morning following an extended song-writing session when the fire broke out, prompting Taylor to act swiftly with a fire extinguisher to extinguish it successfully.</p><p>Describing Taylor's quick response, Gracie praised her, saying, "She was such a legend - I don't know how at this hour or in our state she knew what to do." Reflecting on the aftermath, Gracie mentioned, "We both had an insane cough from the fire extinguisher fumes for weeks."</p><p>While the fire could’ve been disastrous, the song-writing session with Swift was magical, Gracie explained.</p><p>"Something caught our ear at the same time very hard and fast. So, we ran to the piano and started writing this song," she said to Billboard , adding, "I used to fantasize about that type of thing as a kid."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gracie Abrams gained recognition for her debut EP, Minor, in 2020, which explored themes of love and self-discovery.
