With its cast of uncanny, whimsical characters and its tale of a struggling paper company trying desperately to stay afloat all while being filmed for a documentary, it was certainly a long-running hit.

Going on to appear in everything from<strong> Hot Tub Time Machine 2</strong> to <strong>Ghosted</strong>, the former <strong>Darryl Philbin</strong> has kept quite busy in his post-Office days (the show… he was never a mail-carrier). Making a rather hefty name for himself, Robinson continues to be featured in comedic gems year after year, whether on the big screen or within the world of the TV series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-helms-21-movies-12-tv-shows><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ed Helms (21 Movies, 12 TV Shows)</span></h2><p><strong>Ed Helms</strong> was certainly no stranger to prominent feature roles while portraying<strong> Andy Bernard</strong> on <strong>The Office</strong>. Likewise, the actor has had an abundance of success following the end of the beloved series. Staring alongside Christina Applegate in Vacation, sharing the screen with Patti Harrison or standing strong with the likes of <a href=#>Owen Wilson</a> and Glen Close in Father Figures, the “Nard Dog” has continued to shine and thrive.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything 'The Office' Star Brian Baumgartner Has Been Up To Recently</a></span></p><h2 id=rainn-wilson-19-movies-16-tv-shows><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rainn Wilson (19 Movies, 16 TV Shows)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Portraying everybody’s favorite Karate chopping, beet growing, paper salesman, <a href=#>Rainn Wilson </a>made the part of<strong> Dwight K.

However, in the years that followed the end of The Office, Rainn took the same charm and uncanny nature that made his role as Dwight so popular and used it as seasoning for roles moving forward. Starring in the killer shark epic, The Meg and showcasing his non-comedic side in Don't Tell A Soul, Wilson has been quite busy after his time at Dunder Mifflin.</p><h2 id=john-krasinski-15-movies-7-tv-shows><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>John Krasinski (15 Movies, 7 TV Shows)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>John Krasinski</strong> won fans' hearts as the loveable goofball, <strong>Jim Halpert</strong>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Krasinski has gone on to star in a myriad of high-profile roles, not the least of which being the latest Jack Ryan</a>.

Scott</strong>, Detective Michael Scarn, Michael… Scotch, whatever name he chose to use, fans loved the regional manager of the struggling paper company just the same. <strong>Steve Carell</strong> was the fundamental ingredient that made <strong>The Office</strong> work. His ignorant, clueless yet charming take on the character of Scott was not only loved by fans but critics alike. His post-Office (not that again) career was met with much success with memorable roles such as, John du Pont in the tragic true story Foxcatcher. Carell continues to show his versatility as an actor, while often indulging in the wonderful whimsy that made him a star.</p><h2 id=mindy-kaling-9-movies-10-tv-shows><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mindy Kaling (9 Movies, 10 TV Shows)</span></h2><p><strong>Mindy Kaling’s</strong> run as the vapid, Ryan-obsessed Kelly Kapoor was a fun and memorable role that placed the actor within the hearts of millions of Office fans. Much like <strong>Steve Carell</strong>, Mindy would end up leaving the show before its end, only to show up for the finale. Following her departure, Kaling would be featured in hits such as Ocean’s 8 and Late Night, to name a few. The years after The Office have been kind to The Mindy Project star, following her portrayal as the customer service rep of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-fischer-4-movies-8-tv-shows><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jenna Fischer (4 Movies, 8 TV Shows)</span></h2><p>The Llvable, wholesome, art student that was <strong>Pam Beasley</strong> was portrayed wonderfully by <strong>Jenna Fischer</strong> for the entirety of The Office’s 9 years. Capturing fan’s imaginations (and hearts) with her romance with John Krasinski’s Jim, Fischer was one of the show’s more grounded characters. Jenna moved on to be featured in the likes of Brad’s Status and The 15:17 To Paris after her Office run. With no signs of slowing down, fans can expect to see Jenna for years to come.</p><h2 id=b-j-novak-5-movies-5-tv-shows><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>B.J.

Novak’s Ryan Howard</strong> was the overachieving scoundrel of<strong> The Office.</strong> The once wide-eyed yet cynical character was, at times, both loved and loathed by fans of the show. Following in the footsteps of Both Mindy Kaling and Steve Carell, Novak left the show before its finale, only to return for a cameo in the last episode. B.J. soldiered on after The Office finale to be featured in a variety of films, such as The Amazing Spider-man 2 and The Founder.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Cancel Culture Prevails As Several ‘The Office’ And ‘Seinfeld’ Episodes Get Removed</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dpLOntcKeZJyZo6l6uLTOZp%2Baq12luaLFxJ1kpqejqXqzu8ueqmarmaOwpnnToZxmq5ikxG6xzZ2cnWWjqbK3sYycmKudnKF6rrXNnbBmo5Ghtq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alexis-williams-wiki-selling-tampa-partner-age-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Selling Tampa's Alexis Williams?
