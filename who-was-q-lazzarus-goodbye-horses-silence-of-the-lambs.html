Director Jonathan Demme boarded the singer’s cab and was serenaded by her demo track that played during the ride. That fateful encounter led to the Lazzarus’s music getting featured in Demme’s films, including a brief appearance in Philadelphia, where she rendered a cover of Talking Heads’ Heaven. However, Lazzarus went under the radar after her band's disbandment, leaving even her closest friends in the dark about her whereabouts.

Unfortunately, those dreams did not see the light of day due to record labels' reluctance to take a chance on her. According to a band member, these labels considered Lazzarus unmarketable due to her hair. “I’m a big-boned African-American woman who wears dreads, sings American rock and roll – I market myself,’' she would say.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Do Movie Soundtracks Really Make Artists Money?">Do Movie Soundtracks Really Make Artists Money?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-q-lazzarus-disappeared-for-years><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Why Q Lazzarus Disappeared For Years</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/299831781_570785388076266_2235099068062405940_n-(1).jpg><p>For nearly three decades, ‘<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened to Q Lazzarus</a>?’ and ‘Where is Q Lazzarus now?’ were constant questions on the lips of many who had come to appreciate her music.

Galicia entertained fears that the said man must have isolated Lazzarus, but that was far from the case. During her protracted break from the public glare, the singer started a family with her husband and children in Staten Island.</p><h2 id=q-lazzarus-had-a-short-musical-career><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Q Lazzarus Had A Short Musical Career</span></h2><p>Lazzarus’s musical career was short.
