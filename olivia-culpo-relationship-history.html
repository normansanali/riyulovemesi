With that in mind, we're taking a look back at her dating and relationship history. What's more, Olivia recently spoke with Distractify, and revealed some fun details about her current boyfriend.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia Culpo’s relationship history includes Nick Jonas.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>Olivia Culpo dated pop star <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a> between 2013 — when they were spotted kissing at the U.S. Open in New York City — and 2015, when they split.</p><p style=text-align:start>“She’s an amazing person,” Nick told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra</a> after the breakup. “We had a great, beautiful few years together, but it’s been a crazy couple months and I wish the best to her for the future, but it’s tough.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia was linked to football player Tim Tebow in 2015.</h2><p style=text-align:start>After her split from Nick, Olivia was reportedly linked to <a href=#>Tim Tebow</a> for a few months in 2015 after meeting at church, as a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>However, the source added that Olivia didn’t reciprocate the former University of Florida football player’s feelings. “He was very into her,” the source said. “But she just got out of a long-term relationship and was not interested.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe jonas who dated camilla belle who dated tim tebow who dated olivia culpo who dated nick jonas...</p>— SIDEKICK SHELBY (@ShelbyCasanova) <a href=#>October 18, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia had a years-long relationship with football player Danny Amendola.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Olivia was in a relationship with NFL wide receiver Danny Amendola between 2016 and 2019. But as the magazine also reported, Danny dissed her in an Instagram rant months after their breakup.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I believe there should be a boundary [between] private life and social media,” wrote the football player, who played for the St. Louis Rams and the New England Patriots, among other teams. “Olivia believes in [a] fishbowl lifestyle. This fundamental difference was huge in our relationship.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Danny also passed on some of the blame for the downfall of their relationship: “A lot of time, it was my fault [because], let’s be honest, I can be an idiot," he said.

Olivia revealed to Distractify that she broke her own no athlete rule because of Christian's "strong family values."</p><p style=text-align:start>Olivia noted that the only source of stress with Christian was dealing with her nerves during game day.</p><p style=text-align:start>"It's not just the game. It's the night before. I get so nervous. I get nervous for so many different reasons!" Olivia explained. "I just want him to do well, I want it to be a great day. So, there are a lot of emotions that go into watching the game and leading up to a game. I'm just a nervous wreck the whole time."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)</a></p></figure><p style=text-align:start>Olivia's sister Sophia also happens to have a football player boyfriend (New York Jets wide receiver <a href=#>Braxton Berrios</a>). Although the two Culpo boyfriends play for different teams, Olivia joked, "We totally play into [the rivalry], to be honest with you. It makes it so much more fun rooting against one another."</p><p style=text-align:start>However, it's all in good fun. As Olivia told us, "I text Sophie all day on [Braxton's game days too]. 'How's [Braxton] doing?' It's exciting. We're all family."</p><p style=text-align:start>Additional reporting by Katherine Stinson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmqwsiaZJytnKW8br7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2afoqukpL%2B6</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./r-kelly-originally-lsg-johnny-gill.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>R.
