I usually lose weight when I’m off of it,” Gomez posted on the video-sharing website. “I just wanted to say and encourage anyone out there who feels any sort of shame for exactly what they’re going through, and no one knows the real story.”</p><p>The star of Only Murders in the Building went on, “I just want everybody to know how amazing and gorgeous you are.

Not to mention, I believe they’re fantastic. Simply put, I’m not that,” she continued. “I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your support and love for me.

My stroke may have happened,” she told Billboard.</p><p>She revealed to ET Canada later in 2019 that she has high blood pressure, kidney problems, and lupus, which are the main causes of her health concerns. And that’s when I began to notice the body image issues. It combines all of them. I will need to take this drug for the remainder of my life. To be honest, it depends on the month. When people started criticizing me for [my weight], I became aware of it. And that’s simply my reality, to be honest. I change throughout. Depending on what’s going on in my life. And you know, that got to me. That screwed me up for a while, I suppose,” she remarked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summary</h2><p>Selena Gomez candidly discusses the impact of lupus medication on her weight, urging fans not to feel shame.
