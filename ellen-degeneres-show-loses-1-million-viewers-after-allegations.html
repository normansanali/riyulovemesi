It is a 43 percent overall decline, with a 38 percent decline in DeGeneres’ core audience of adult women under the age of 54.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ellen-DeGeneres-Show-Loses-1-Million-Viewers-After-Toxic-Workplace-Allegations.jpg><p>The Ellen DeGeneres Show has also seen a significant drop in ad revenue. Nielsen said that the Emmy-winning program brought in $131 million from advertisers between September 2019 and January 2020 but only $105 million between September 2020 and January 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>The New York Times </a>on Monday, March 22, Warner Bros. executive <strong>David McGuire</strong> pointed out that the series “remains one of the top three highest-rated syndicated talk shows this season” and suggested that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is to blame for the decline in ratings.</p><p>“While broadcast is down across the board and COVID has been challenging for production, we are looking forward to bringing back our live audiences and a 19th season filled with all of the hilarious and heartwarming moments that have made Ellen one of the longest-running and most successful talk shows in history,” he said.</p><p>Ellen is not the only show that has been impacted by the pandemic.&nbsp;The Kelly Clarkson Show and Dr. Phil’s ratings are&nbsp;down 26 and 22 percent, respectively, while&nbsp;Tamron Hall and&nbsp;Live With Kelly and Ryan have seen smaller drops of nine and three percent. (Live and&nbsp;Dr. Phil are the only two talk shows with more viewers than&nbsp;Ellen, at 2.7 million and 2.5 million, respectively.)</p><p>The comedian, 63, was in hot water in July 2020 after one current and 10 former employees claimed to BuzzFeed News that they had <a href=#>faced racism, fear and intimidation</a> while working on her show. The fallout continued later that month when the website published a second report including 36 former staffers’ allegations of <a href=#>harassment, sexual misconduct and assault</a> against top producers.</p><p>Warner Bros. subsequently <a href=#>launched an internal investigation</a>, and three producers exited the series.</p><p>DeGeneres <a href=#>apologized to her staff in an email</a> obtained by Us Weekly in July 2020, which read in part, “On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be a place of happiness — no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect. Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Seriously…I’m Kidding author also addressed the scandal in a <a href=#>five-minute monologue during September’s premiere</a>, saying, “I know that I am in a position of privilege and power, and I realize that with that comes responsibility. And I take responsibility for what happens at my show.”</p><p>DeGeneres’ guests in recent weeks have included&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>.</p><p>The Ellen DeGeneres Show airs weekdays.
