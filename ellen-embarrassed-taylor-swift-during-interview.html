Let's... I'm going to give you a chance to clear it up. When you have spare time, you drive past your ex-boyfriends' houses.

I'm like 'in my free time I like to drive past my ex-boyfriends' houses."</p><p>Taylor mimicked typing as she explained that she's not "like throwing eggs," just "checking up on them."</p><p>Both the audience and Ellen seemed amused at that point, but Ellen also took the MySpace confession quite seriously. She teased Taylor, who called it an "act of public service" that she checked up on her exes.</p><p>Taylor finally ended the line of questioning by declaring, "Everybody does that, it's just nobody admits to it."</p><p>Ellen might have given up at that point, but she would bring up the drive-by tidbit in future interviews, never letting Taylor forget about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-wouldn-39-t-let-taylor-forget-her-stalker-ish-confession>Ellen Wouldn't Let Taylor Forget Her Stalker-Ish Confession</h2><h3 id=on-another-episode-of-ellen-taylor-swift-was-reminded-of-her-bad-habit>On another episode of Ellen, Taylor Swift was reminded of her bad habit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-was-completely-caught-off-guard-after-ellen-brought-out-her-secret-music-crush.jpg><p>As uncomfortable as her second interview might have been with Ellen, Taylor Swift returned many more times throughout the talk show host's run. Later in 2008, Taylor sat on Ellen's stage and admitted that Joe Jonas had dumped her during a brief phone call.</p><p>At the time, Taylor was promoting her album Fearless and admitted there was one song on the album about her most recent ex.

The interview concluded without any more mention of Taylor's old embarrassing moment, but other interviews didn't go quite as smoothly.</p><h2 id=ellen-degeneres-sometimes-charms-taylor-and-sometimes-drags-her>Ellen DeGeneres Sometimes Charms Taylor (And Sometimes Drags Her)</h2><h3 id=taylor-swift-has-appeared-on-ellen-many-times-but-not-every-appearance-goes-well>Taylor Swift has appeared on Ellen many times, but not every appearance goes well</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taylor-swift-on-the-ellen-degeneres-show.jpg><p>During some of Taylor's appearances on Ellen, the singer seemed to feel comfortable and respected.

Fans may have had more to say about her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show than she did though.</p><p>It was widely interpreted as Ellen dragging Taylor when the talk show host tried to get Swift to confirm (by ringing a bell) which men she actually dated out of a pool of rumored beaus. Taylor flat-out told Ellen that she wasn't feeling very good about herself, and also defended herself when Ellen seemed to hint that Taylor was lying about not having dated Zac Efron.</p><p>While some fans are still unsure whether Taylor might have dated Zac on the down-low, Taylor wasn't having it when it came to Ellen inquiring about her love life.
