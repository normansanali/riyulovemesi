Biggers is alleging that a massive conspiracy of corporations, government agencies, and wrestling personalities worked together to interfere in her ongoing child custody and aggravated kidnapping case.</p><p>Amazingly, Dwayne Johnson isn’t the biggest name on the list of defendants, as in total, the former <a href=#>WWE</a>/TNA wrestler is suing all of the following: The FBI, The El Pase Child Protective Services, New Mexico Police Department, Home Depot, <a href=#>NYPD</a>, Bank of America, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, The NWA, Billy Corgan (yes, the Smashing Pumpkins lead singer owns The NWA), Mick Foley, Jim Cornette, Chris Benoit (long dead), Con Edison, and of course, Michael Jordan. That’s not even the entire list.</p><p>As for why Dwayne Johnson and seemingly everyone else involved in wrestling circa 2006-2011 is being sued, the only reasons are vague “conspiracy” allegations. On the face of it, a suit this absurd has only moved forward after Trenasha Biggers paid upfront for all court fees. In all likelihood, it will be dismissed once it’s in front of a judge, especially given Biggers ongoing court case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rhaka-khan.jpg><p>That’s right, the $3 billion lawsuit is tied to Trenasha Biggers’s ongoing case in which she is being charged with “interference with child custody” and “aggravated kidnapping.” Biggers is alleging that Dwayne Johnson and Michael Jordan are two of the individuals responsible for her being in court and that in doing so, her career is being adversely affected by the conspiracy. Her career as Rhaka Khan spanned 2006-2011, including multiple matches in <a href=#>Japan</a>, TNA, and Lucha Libre USA, with her last match in May 2011 (via <a href=#>Cagematch</a>), eight years before charges were filed and 12 before alleging a conspiracy was derailing her career.</p><p>All of that is to say that Dwayne Johnson was very likely not involved in a grand conspiracy to kidnap the children of a WWE developmental talent. He definitely did not do so with the help of Michael Jordan and Chris Benoit, especially since the latter has been dead since 2007. The Japanese companies and Lucha Libre USA are absent from the wide-ranging list of defendants, as are her former trainers, Bill DeMott and Marty Janetty, which means there was some logic to the list at some point.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson and the rest of the names in the suit aren’t likely to lose any sleep over the court filing. The recent Dominion Voting Systems suit against Fox News was settled for under a billion. That was one of the largest ever filed, making the $3 billion requested for damages by Trenasha Bigger even more absurd, so it’s just a matter of time before it’s thrown out of court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnlKyuurrEZqGooJ6ovK950q6cnWWnrLJuv9OaqWegpKK5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-dean-net-worth-256549.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eddie Dean Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cvs-walmart-cutting-pharmacy-hours-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>CVS and Walmart Are Cutting Pharmacy Hours, Starting in March</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
