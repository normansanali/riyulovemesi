Nonetheless, throughout his career, he has become somewhat of a controversial figure. This has led to&nbsp;polarizing opinions within the wrestling community. We expand on the fraught chatter on Ric Flair and his controversy, career accolades, and what it says.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Who is Ric Flair?</h2><p>Ric Flair, born Richard Morgan Fliehr on February 25, 1949, is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, having worked for multiple organizations such as Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE), and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He is a wrestling legend widely recognized as one of many greatest pro wrestlers of his generation, and historic record time in which he hosted several titles, and awards ushering his widespread reach and influence longevity throughout his wrestling career.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Controversies</h2><p><strong>1. Racial Controversy</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>One of the many high-profile controversies that plagued Ric Flair was a situation involving WWE Hall of Famer Teddy Long, who stated that Flair several times called him a racial slur and threatened him. The bad blood surrounding that incident is part of the reason why Flair became a certain pariah among wrestling circles.<br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>2. Off-screen Rivalries</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>Flair has had a rivalry with Bret Hart off-screen, and the allegations and derogatory claims made by him in public have only helped him develop a reputation for controversy. Hart criticized Flair's abilities, use of ring psychology, and what he believed was Flair's poor blade job.<br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>3. Feuds and Accusations</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>For years, Douglas had run afoul of Flair in public interviews, claiming that Flair had buried him at every turn and accusing him of steroid abuse (which led to a back-and-forth public exchange of accusations).<br data-mce-fragment=1>Legacy and Accomplishments</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In-ring Prowess</h2><p>Controversies aside, there's no question Flair still knows how to shine in the ring. He was revered for his ability to tell stories in matches, his versatility to work with a wide variety of wrestling styles, and his often unparalleled charisma that helped to make him stand out in both heel and face roles.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on Wrestling Industry</h2><p>The legacy of Flair in the wrestling industry is a glacier. He is respected, however, and his role was an exalted one to elevate other wrestlers and territories in defeat, over his fifty-two years in the business, his commitment to the art has sealed his legend.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Diverging Perspectives</h2><p>For some fans, Flair is a polarizing figure, in part because of the personal conduct and rivalries that have accompanied his career; however, others regard him as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time and the only wrestler to hold 16 championships. Regardless of the controversy, Flair's wrestling accolades and his uncanny ability to have the audience&nbsp;love him&nbsp;have resulted in him taking a special place in the heart of many a wrestling fan.<br data-mce-fragment=1>So that is the backlash to Ric's wrestling star-studded career. Whatever else came his way, arrests, the bad press, his ability to perform in the ring had the biggest influence on the sport. His influence on the world of wrestling, and his legacy have seen him become one of the wrestling's icons.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miusJ1frLW6edaaqmaqmZh6p7jAoqlmq59isLC606umr52iqLaiuIyipWagmah6uL7ErKuloZ6ceqSt0Z6cqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yolanda-adams-my-liberty-1668909-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yolanda Adams My Liberty lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-steven-ray-morris-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-and-rumours-2-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Steven Ray Morris Dating Now?
