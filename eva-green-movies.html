She <strong>breathed life into Vanessa Ives so beautifully</strong>, giving the show that was occasionally quirky its signature weight and emotion. Green is an underrated actress and deserves lots more coverage and attention; if not for her great acting skills, then for being so effortlessly cool. Fans who miss <a href=#>Penny Dreadful</a>'s Monster Universe and Eva Green can turn to her filmography and <strong>check out some of her best films</strong>.

Sci-fi fans are often used to spectacular visuals and dramatic effects, but Proxima is only science fiction in the astronaut aspect; <strong>Jordan Mintzer</strong> from <strong>The Hollywood Reporter</strong> called it "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">realistic in terms of its setting and technical specificity</a>, it sometimes feels like a documentary."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At its core, Proxima is a <strong>drama depicting a relationship between mother and daughter</strong>. As Sarah prepares to leave Earth for a year and live on the ISS (International Space Station), she needs to navigate her relationship with her young daughter Stella (<strong>Zélie Boulant-Lemesle</strong>) and face the fact that they won't see each other for a while. Green's greatest strength lies in understated roles and performances, which is evident in Proxima. Starring as a woman who must show coldness in the presence of her colleagues while juggling intense emotions for her daughter, she perfectly balances the two emotional spectrums, <strong>potentially drawing inspiration from real-life working mothers</strong>.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Tubi</a></span></p><h2>'Nocebo' (2022)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=as-christine>As Christine</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><p><a href=#><strong>Vivarium</strong></a> director <strong>Lorcan Finnegan</strong> dives into medicinal folklore with <strong>Nocebo</strong>; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the name stems from the opposite effect</a> gained from a placebo, or <strong>when the dummy medicine causes negative side effects on a person's health</strong>.

It was written and directed by <a href=#><strong>Ridley Scott</strong></a>'s daughter, <strong>Jordan Scott</strong>, who <strong>based it on the same-name 1999 novel by Sheila Kohler</strong>. Green portrays the <strong>enigmatic and charming Miss G</strong>, the swimming coach in an all-girls school; Temple plays Di, a typical teenage girl with a clique, feeling on top of the world when things are going her way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Valverde plays the Spanish-born newcomer Fimia, a timid and well-behaved girl with asthma issues. When <strong>Miss G becomes obsessed with Fimia</strong>, the dynamic in Di's clique switches from idolizing their coach to plotting how to get rid of her new favorite. Cracks<strong> </strong>explores various characters and dynamics, from school bullying on a group level to troubled individuals. Eva Green carries the movie <strong>with her sophisticated portrayal of a hedonistic woman</strong> who should probably not be a teacher, but is, and is very beloved by pupils. Suffice it to say <a href=#>she's often cast as a femme fatale</a>, and Cracks helps her dive behind such a facade and play a woman that's essentially empty and deprived.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Tubi</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-the-salvation-39-2014><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'The Salvation' (2014)</span></h2><h3 id=as-madelaine>As Madelaine</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><p>A <a href=#>Danish Western might sound unusual</a>, but <strong>The Salvation</strong> director <strong>Kristian Levring</strong> drew inspiration from real life. <strong>Many Danish soldiers fled to the US during the 19th century</strong> in search of a new life after military defeat; this tense Western fictionalizes one Danish soldier's life amid moving to the Wild West. <strong>Mads Mikkelsen</strong> plays Jon, a man who doesn't show a lot of emotion in general, <strong>keeping most of it for his wife and son</strong>.

While Jon is on the journey of survival, Madelaine is there to exact revenge and free herself from the violent shackles of the Delarues. Even <a href=#>the best Westerns of all time</a> rarely depict strong and capable women who successfully fight adversity, but with Eva Green in The Salvation, one thing's for sure - she is meant to be <strong>a fierce woman ready to take her fate into her own hands</strong>.

With their second (or technically third) collaboration last year, Eva Green and <strong><a href=#>Vincent Cassel</a> </strong>(<a href=#>after the series<strong> Liaison</strong></a>) <strong>return to screens as Athos and Milady de Winter</strong>. While the first installment focuses on D'Artagnan, the second is all about Green's character Milady de Winter.

She slips into the role of Milady easily, tackling fight scenes as well as delivering lines confidently and with conviction. <strong>There's lots of sword fighting and action that Green feels natural in</strong>, and she said in an interview for <strong>France Today</strong> that she "<a href=#>embraced the villainy</a>" of Milady de Winter, stating "It’s fun because it’s very far from what we are in daily life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rent on AppleTV+</a></span></p><h2 id=39-miss-peregrine-39-s-home-for-peculiar-children-39-2016><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' (2016)</span></h2><h3 id=as-miss-peregrine>As Miss Peregrine</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><p><a href=#><strong>Tim Burton</strong></a> is a beloved director with numerous hits under his directing belt, and when <strong>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</strong> came out, it was welcomed with high anticipation.

Michael and Isabelle meet at the cinema, <strong>bonded by their love of film</strong>. When Isabelle and Theo's parents leave for the summer, they invite Michael to stay with them, and he accepts. The Dreamers is an homage to cinema, particularly the New Wave, but the movie's driving force is undoubtedly Isabelle, or, better said, Eva Green (who debuted in this film.)

The story revolves around the conflict that took place in the 12th century when the Western Empires went to Jerusalem to free it from the captivity of the sultan Saladin.
