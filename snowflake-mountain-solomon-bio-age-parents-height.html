But, all the enthusiasm swept away when they reached the set, of mother nature.</p><p>A $50,000 cash reward is up for grabs, so efforts are not in vain. The candidates will learn how to compete, network, outsmart rivals, and do whatever else is required to come out on top in the end.</p><p>The contestants are <a href=#>Sunny</a>, Deandra, Liam Brown, Randy Wentworth, Rae Hume, <a href=#>Darriea Clark</a>, <a href=#>Olivia Lagaly</a>, Devon Smith, and Solomon.</p><p>You’ll discover information related to Solomon’s life after this.
