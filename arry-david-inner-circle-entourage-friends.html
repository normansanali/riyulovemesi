He makes that abundantly clear in Curb Your Enthusiasm and even in Seinfeld. Then there's every interview he's ever done where he's said basically the same thing... he "hates people", "parties are death", etc., etc. And yet, Larry David does have some notable celebrity friendships. Of course, there's <a href=#>Larry and Timothee Chalamet's new and strange friendship</a> which broke the internet in fall 2021. But Larry has some more established and lengthy friendships worth knowing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some of Larry's famous friends are exactly who his fans think, others are a tad more obscure. This is because as much as Larry complains about social interaction, he's actually quite well-rounded and has an ability to talk with just about anyone. But who does he actually LIKE talking to? Aside from <a href=#>his wife, who is 38 years his junior</a>, as well as his two daughters (Cazzie and Romy), here's who Larry spends the most time with...</p><h2 id=president-barack-obama><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>President Barack Obama</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Larry may not spend as much time with former President Barack Obama as he would like, the two are very good golf buddies. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his interview on The Rich Eisen Show</a>, Larry has golfed with the former president numerous times alongside Big Bang Theory creator Chuck Lorre and businessman Ari Emanuel. On top of this, Larry made a lot of news when he was actually happy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was disinvited from the former president's birthday</a> in 2021 due to COVID restrictions. Still, Larry is close enough with Barack Obama to have scored an invite.</p><h2 id=jeff-garlin><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jeff Garlin</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No one makes Jeff Garlin laugh more than Larry David</a>. His Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star has told many stories about their friendship in interviews for the show. Clearly, the relationship we see onscreen between Jeff and Larry isn't too dissimilar to their dynamic in real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jerry-seinfeld><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jerry Seinfeld</span></h2><p>Even after co-creating the most successful sitcom of all time and being with each other for nearly a solid decade, Larry and Jerry have maintained a strong friendship. The two constantly speak highly of each other in public and claim to spend a decent amount of time together in private. Their banter is akin to two people who've known each other their entire lives. But that's what the experience of making Seinfeld gave them... it made them like brothers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Larry David And Jerry Seinfeld's Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-lewis><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Richard Lewis</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everything Larry does makes Richard complain. And everything Richard does makes Larry complain. Their relationship is almost identical to what happens between them on Curb. The two actually have known each other since summer camp days when they absolutely hated each other. When they ran into one another again as stand-ups, they even got into a fistfight recalling their youth. But shortly after, they became absolutely inseparable... even when they're at each other's throats.</p><h2 id=amy-schumer><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Amy Schumer</span></h2><p>Larry David is close enough to Amy Schumer to have been invited to her wedding. This is where he notoriously met <a href=#>Jennifer Lawerence who soon developed a massive crush on him</a>. According to Jennifer, Amy also scolded her for getting too friendly with Larry who didn't seem to be interested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jb-smoove><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>JB Smoove</span></h2><p>Much like Jeff Garlin and Richard Lewis, Larry's relationship with JB Smoove isn't that dissimilar to their dynamic on Curb Your Enthusiasm. After meeting at auditions for Curb, the two quickly took to each other. Larry has credited JB with making him laugh more than anyone. But Larry returns the favor honestly, like when he publicly criticized JB when he failed to show up to his own birthday party on time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Larry David And JB Smoove Friends IRL? Here's What We Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=steve-martin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Steve Martin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to Richard Lewis' interview on The Rich Eisen Show, we know that Larry occasionally plays poker with the acclaimed comedian and actor. Larry also was personally asked to present Steve with his Mark Twain Award.</p><h2 id=susie-essman><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Susie Essman</span></h2><p>Susie Essman and Larry David go way back. Unlike their Curb Your Enthusiasm counterparts, the pair actually adore each other. They have ever since they were starting out as stand-up comedians. While Susie built a more traditional standup career, she claimed that Larry was a "comedian's comedian", meaning his colleagues thought he was brilliant while the audience... well... not so much. Of course, that all changed when Larry started writing. His relationship with Susie lasted all these years as she's now one of his most frequent collaborators.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cheryl-hines><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cheryl Hines</span></h2><p>Larry's on-screen ex-wife is also close with him in real life. Unlike any of her co-stars, she's even close enough to pitch Larry Curb Your Enthusiasm storylines, some of which he's actually used on the show.</p><h2 id=jason-alexander><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jason Alexander</span></h2><p>Larry and Jason just can't seem to stop working together. Of course, Jason was playing a version of Larry in George Costanza on Seinfeld. Jason later joined the cast of Curb Your Enthusiasm for a handful of episodes. And then Jason played the lead in Larry's Broadway show, "A Fish In The Dark". Because of this, few people know Larry as well as Jason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Jason Alexander Found Out He Was Playing Larry David On 'Seinfeld'</a></span></p><h2 id=julia-louis-dreyfus><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</span></h2><p>During his speech at Julia's Mark Twain Award evening, Larry said that "working with her was like being in charge of The Hope Diamond. I felt vastly protective and constantly in awe." Their time working together on Seinfeld brought Julia and Larry together but they had actually worked on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> previously. Because of their history, Julia and Larry have found themselves in one another's inner circle.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jimmy Kimmel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Larry is a frequent guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and that's no coincidence. The two are friendly off-screen, although they are at the beginning of their personal relationship. During a recent interview, Larry explained that he was s a bit surprised that he was invited to Jimmy's house for dinner but took the invitation... except he accidentally showed up a day early when Jimmy wasn't home. However, the two seem to be making an effort to build a stronger bond off-camera.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Larry David Is Actually Like, According to Fans Who've Met Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6qpYrGiwsidZKKmnpq%2Fbq%2FIq5qlnV2au7W71KuYoJ1dm7%2Bqsc2dqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thanatotheristes-degrootorum-reaper-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyrannosaurus Rex's Older Cousin, 'Reaper Of Death,' Discovered In Canada</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stevie-nicks-backup-singers-sharon-celani-and-lori-nicks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stevie Nicks Backup Singers: Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
