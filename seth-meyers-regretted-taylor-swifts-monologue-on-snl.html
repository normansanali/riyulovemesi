And I don't know, she was a kid. She was like 19 years old. She goes, 'No one came to me and gave me any advice.' That's a problem."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The host addressed how "people think you're supposed to know what to do when you're hosting Saturday Night Live." He called it a "tremendous task," with Meyers saying it's "insane." Looking back, the latter said "what's even crazier" is that he didn't realize that until three years after his exit from the sketch comedy after a 12.5-year stint.</p><p>Back then, he returned to the show as a first-time guest host. "If you asked me what it was like to host, I would tell you today — and I worked there longer than almost anybody — I was like, Howard, no one tells you anything," Meyers admitted. "Even I, who had worked there, couldn't believe how it works."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift was the first Saturday Night Live host to write their own monologue.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mariah-carey-seemed-very-insulted-by-howard-stern.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Mariah Carey Seemed Insulted By Howard Stern Objectifying Her During An Uncomfortable Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Mariah Carey appeared to be extremely uncomfortable because of Howard Stern objectifying her.</span><h2 id=seth-meyers-felt-guilty-about-not-guiding-taylor-swift-on-her-snl-monologue>Seth Meyers Felt Guilty About Not Guiding Taylor Swift On Her SNL Monologue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-2023-11-30-at-3-31-44-pm.png><p>After Meyers' hosting gig on SNL, he "retroactively felt so guilty" about the way he treated guest hosts, including Swift, back when he was still a cast member. He clarified that he was "always very polite," that he "always wanted them to score," and that "if they won, I felt like I won." However, he often responded to their sketch concerns from a mindset of "Just f---ing do it... We wrote it, just do it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then remembered how Swift's performance "speaks to what a force of nature she is and the depths of her talent." He said: "Here's a 19-year-old, who again nobody is really helping out, nobody gave her a manual of how to do that show, and yet she came to us and said, 'I wrote a song for the opening monologue.'"</p><p>In the song, the All Too Well hitmaker joked about her signature "glitter and sparkly dresses" and making "songs about douchebags that cheat on me." She also mentioned her recent ex at that time, Joe Jonas, singing: "You might think I'd bring up Joe, that guy that broke up with me on the phone, but I'm not going to mention that in my monologue. Hey Joe, I'm doing well."</p><p>Here are <a href=#>all the times Swift graced the SNL stage</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>January 2009</p></td><td><p>SNL debut; performed Love Story and Forever and Always; performed Tomorrow as Annie on a Save Broadway skit.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November 2009</p></td><td><p>First time hosting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>February 2015</p></td><td><p>SNL's 40th anniversary; played cousin Alison who "just got a small role in a Hollywood space" in the Californians sketch</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November 2017</p></td><td><p>Performed Ready for It? and Call It What You Want ahead of the Reputation album's release</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2019</p></td><td><p>Performed stripped down versions of Lover and False God</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>November 2021</p></td><td><p>Performed the 10-minute version of All Too Well on TV for the first time; lent her vocals to the Three Sad Virgins sketch hosted by <strong><a href=#>Pete Davidson</a></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2023</p></td><td><p>Introduced her Karma collaborator, Ice Spice's Pretty Girl performance (her musical guest debut on the show)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jennifer-lawrence-looking-horrified.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Seth Meyers May Have Handled It Well, But Was Jennifer Lawrence's Admission Of Her Crush A Bad Move?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jennifer Lawrence admitted a crush on Seth Meyers, but not everyone thought it was cute or innocent.</span><h2 id=taylor-swift-wrote-a-quot-perfect-snl-monologue-quot-on-her-own>Taylor Swift Wrote A "Perfect SNL Monologue" On Her Own</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar48417894.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite feeling bad about not guiding Swift for her SNL hosting debut, Meyers praised the Anti-Hero performer for coming up with "a perfect SNL monologue" on her own.

Fully formed," he recounted.</p><p>"To this day, I've never had a moment like that where someone brings you a fully gift-wrapped present and it's exactly what you need it to be," he continued. He went on to express his regret for how he reacted to Swift's script.
