It has been estimated that Couples’ net worth is $105 million, which has mainly come from his career as a professional golf player, and the sum might grow in the future, as Fred continues to play golf and is involved in other business activities.</p><h3>Fred Couples Net Worth $105 Million</h3><p>From a very young age Fred became familiar with golf courses, and practiced playing the game. After finishing O’Dea High School, Couples won a scholarship to study at University of Houston, and played in the Houston Cougars golf team, after which he joined the US PGA tour in 1980. In 1983 Fred won his first victory, in the Kemper Open, and over the next 25 years, Couples won another fourteen PGA Tour titles, including two Players Championships in 1984 and 1996, although only one of the majors, the 1992 Masters Tournament. However, in the same year he was the leading money winner – which obviously increased his net worth considerably – and was named PGA Tour Player of the Year, following the same title the previous year. These acheivements of course made him more famous and respected.</p><p>Fred continued to show his impressive skills while playing and had won many tournaments, including three on the European Tour, and&nbsp; particularly in match play, even becoming known as ‘Mr. Skins’, a tournament which he has won five times. Addionally, Fred Couples has been named in the US Ryder Cup team five times, which of course added to Fred’s net worth.</p><p>In 2010 Fred Couples started to play on the (Senior) Champion Tour, winning the Tour Rookie of the Year award, as he won such events as Cap Cana Championship, The ACE Group Classis and Toshiba Classic. Unfortunately he was runner-up US Senior Open and Senior PGA Championship, but Fred won Senior Players Championship in 2011 and The British Senior Open Championship in 2012; these of course had a huge impact on the growth of Fred Couples’ net worth.</p><p>What is more, Fred was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame and National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2013. In addition to this, Fred designs golf courses, and has a firm called Couple Bates Gold Design: these activities have done Fred Couples’ net worth no harm at all..</p><p>To talk about Fred Couple’s personal life, he was first married to Deborah (1981-1993) and then to Thais Baker from 1998 until her passing from cancer in 2009. Despite the fact that he has lost one of the most important people in his life, Couples is still able to remain strong and achieve his dreams, including overcoming several back problems which limited his play somewhat over the years. Finally, it can be said that Fred Couples is one of the most successful golf players,;during his career he has achieved a lot and has been able to gain respect from fellow golferss. There is no surprise that Fred Couples’ net worth is so high as he is a talented golf player and still continues to play.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.887147335423><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Fred Couples</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$105 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 3, 1959</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Seattle, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>185 lbs (84 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Golfer, Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Houston</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Thais Baker (m. 1998–2009), Deborah Couples (m. 1981–1993)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Violet Sobich Couples, Tom Couples</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Tom Couples Jr., Cindy Couples</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Frederick Steven Couples , Boom Boom , Frederick Stephen Couples</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183649</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Best Male Golfer ESPY Award</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Monday Night Golf</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=5.3676470588235><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Fred Couples' favorite golfer when he was growing up was Arnold Palmer.</td></tr><tr readability=1.6727272727273><td>2</td><td>Roomed at college with CBS Sports announcer <a href=#>Jim Nantz</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Co-owns development company Couples/Bates Golf Design (www.couplesbates.com)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1992 Masters champion.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>5</td><td>His father changed the family's surname from Coppola to Couples because, Fred told an interviewer, he thought Coppola sounded "too Italiano."</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypictures.org/thumbs/0183649/0183649_1.jpeg><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Tin Cup</td><td>1996</td><td></td><td>PGA Tour Golfer</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=2.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Mike & Mike</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Guest</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Players Championship Preview Show 2001</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Tiger Woods: Son, Hero & Champion</td><td>1997</td><td>Video documentary short</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypictures.org/thumbs/0183649/0183649_2.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/183649_Fred-Couples/183649_Tin-Cup-1996.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp%2BpnpxdmLy2vMueqmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hanna-hilsdorf-wiki-is-she-dating-anyone-actress-age-and-net-worth-explore.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hanna Hilsdorf Wiki: Is She Dating Anyone?
