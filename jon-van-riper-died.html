When I heard the news yesterday i literally had to pull over on the side of the road. The stories, the smiles, the laughter you brought to everyone is unbelievable. That’s how much you meant to everyone. You would always bring a dark room and fill it with light and make everyone smiling and laughing and if you didn’t know someone there you did sooner then later with your laugh and loud voice. You were so good at bringing people out of there shy shell and opening them up. I’ve never met someone with so many different golf button up shirts with the crazy designs. I will miss your good morning snaps every day and your count down every day till the work week was over. It’s not goodbye man, it’s see ya later. Miss ya buddy I know your up there burning the tires on on your dream truck and shooting par on your favorite golf coarse and of coarse getting all the ladies digits haha.
