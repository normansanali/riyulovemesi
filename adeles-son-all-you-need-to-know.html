The British singer has won multiple awards and has a legion of fans all over the world. However, beyond her music career, Adele is also a mother to her son, Angelo Adkins.</p><p>Angelo Adkins was born on October 19, 2012, and is the only child of Adele and her ex-husband, Simon Konecki. Despite Adele’s fame, she has kept her son out of the spotlight and has been very private about her family life. However, she has shared some details about her son in interviews and on social media.</p><p>In this article, we will explore everything we know about Adele’s son, Angelo Adkins. From his birth to his current age, we will take a closer look at the life of this young boy who holds a special place in Adele’s heart.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Adeles_Son>Early Life of Adele’s Son</span></h2><p><a href=#>Adele’s son</a>, Angelo Adkins, was born on October 19, 2012, in Brighton, England. He is the only child of Adele and her former husband, Simon Konecki.</p><p>Growing up, Angelo has been raised mostly out of the public eye. Adele and Konecki have been private about their son’s upbringing, and have made few public appearances with him. However, Adele has occasionally shared glimpses of her life as a mother on social media and in interviews.</p><p>In 2015, Adele revealed that Angelo was a big fan of her music, and that he particularly enjoyed listening to her hit song “Someone Like You.” She also shared that Angelo had a talent for singing, and that he often sang along with her when she practiced at home.</p><p>In a 2016 interview with Vanity Fair, Adele spoke about the challenges of balancing motherhood with her career. She explained that she had taken time off from music to focus on raising Angelo, and that she had struggled with guilt over being away from him while on tour.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Adele has made it clear that her son is her top priority. In her acceptance speech at the 2022 BRIT Awards, she dedicated her win to Konecki and Angelo, saying “I love you so much, kiddo. You’re the reason I do what I do.”</p><h2><span id=Parentage>Parentage</span></h2><p>Adele is the proud mother of one child, a son named Angelo Adkins. She gave birth to Angelo on October 19, 2012, with her then-partner, Simon Konecki.</p><p>Simon Konecki is a businessman who co-founded Life Water, a company that provides ethically sourced bottled water. He and Adele started dating in 2011 and were married in 2018. In April 2019, the couple announced their separation, and their divorce was finalized in March 2021.</p><p>Adele and Simon are committed to co-parenting their son, and they have been spotted together on several occasions attending events with Angelo. Despite their separation, they maintain a friendly relationship and are dedicated to raising their son together.</p><p>Angelo’s middle name, Adkins, is Adele’s surname. This is a common practice in the United Kingdom, where children can be given their mother’s or father’s surname as a middle name. The name Angelo means “messenger” or “angel” in Italian, and it is a popular name in Italy and other European countries.</p><p>Overall, Adele and Simon’s commitment to co-parenting their son has been a priority for both of them, and they continue to put their son’s well-being first.</p><h2><span id=Public_Appearances>Public Appearances</span></h2><p>Adele’s son Angelo Adkins has been spotted in public with his mother on several occasions. Despite Adele’s efforts to keep her son out of the spotlight, paparazzi have managed to capture a few glimpses of the young boy over the years.</p><p>One notable public appearance was in 2017 when Adele brought Angelo with her to the Grammy Awards. The two were seen walking the red carpet together, with Angelo looking dapper in a suit and tie. The mother-son duo also took the stage to accept Adele’s award for Album of the Year, with Angelo cheering his mom on from the sidelines.</p><p>Another public appearance was in 2019 when Adele and Angelo attended a Spice Girls concert in London. The two were seen dancing and singing along to the girl group’s hits, with Adele even posting a photo of herself wearing a Spice Girls t-shirt on Instagram.</p><p>Despite these rare public appearances, Adele has made it clear that she wants to protect her son’s privacy. In a 2016 interview with Vanity Fair, she stated, “I’ll be protecting him for the rest of his life. He can’t make the decision to be public. I’m not going to do that to him.”</p><p>It is clear that Adele values her son’s privacy and will continue to do her best to keep him out of the public eye as much as possible.</p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>Adele is very involved with her son Angelo’s education. According to a source close to the singer, she “loves her mommy time” and is “very hands-on” with her son’s schooling .</p><p>Angelo is currently seven years old, and it is unclear what type of school he attends. However, Adele has been known to be very protective of her son’s privacy, so it is unlikely that any details about his school will be made public.</p><p>In a recent interview with Vogue, Adele shared that she has been homeschooling Angelo during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said that she has been “trying to be very careful” with her son’s education and has been “doing a lot of homeschooling”.</p><p>It is clear that Adele values education and is committed to ensuring that her son receives a quality education, whether it be through traditional schooling or homeschooling.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>https://people.com/music/adele-very-involved-son-angelo/</a></li><li>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>https://www.capitalfm.com/news/adele-son-angelo-adkins-age/</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>https://www.vogue.com/article/adele-cover-may-2021</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKG0rbvBmqOuqJSWwaa%2FjZympmeRmbKtsdJmqqimXZa5rXnYqKxmppWasW7Azmaip6enZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1141-angel-number-meaning-significance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angel Number 1141 Meaning And Significance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brighter-than-the-sun-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Colbie Caillat Brighter Than the</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-martin.html>Chris Martin Married, Wife, Girlfriends, Net Worth, Income, Earnings, Coldplay</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./graham-nash.html>Graham Nash</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./harriet-dyer-2.html>Harriet Dyer Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rob-lowes-wife-sheryl-berkoff-a-jewelry-designer-wikipedia-bio-age-330987-html.html>Is Rob Lowes Wife Sheryl Berkoff A Jewelry Designer?
